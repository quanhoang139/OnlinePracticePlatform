If we are immersed in a culture that is unlike our own, we may experience culture shock and become disoriented when we come into contact with a fundamentally different culture. People naturally use their own culture as the standard to judge other cultures; however, passing judgment could reach a level where people begin to discriminate against others whose “ways of being” are different than <strong><u>their</u> </strong>own—essentially, we tend to fear that which we do not understand.<br>Cultural diversity is important because our country, workplaces, and schools increasingly consist of various cultural, racial, and ethnic groups. We can learn from one another, but first we must have a level of understanding about each other in order to facilitate collaboration and cooperation. Learning about other cultures helps us understand different perspectives within the world in which we live and helps <strong><u>dispel</u> </strong>negative stereotypes and personal biases about different groups.<br>In addition, cultural diversity helps us recognize and respect “ways of being” that are not necessarily our own, so that as we interact with others, we can build bridges to trust, respect, and understanding across cultures. Furthermore, this diversity makes our country a more interesting place to live, as people from diverse cultures contribute language skills, new ways of thinking, new knowledge, and different experiences.<br><i>(Adapted from https:</i><i><u>//w</u></i><i>ww</i><i><u>.purdueglobal.edu/)</u></i>",

However, scientists who study the brain have learned many interesting things, especiallyfrom studying the brains of daydreamers. In fact, far from being a waste of time, some scientists believethat daydreaming is a healthy and useful activity for all of our brains.<br>In order to study the brain, scientists use special devices that scan the brain and show pictures of which parts of the brain are active at certain times. When a person is daydreaming, the device will show a <strong><u>distinct</u></strong> pattern of activity in the brain called the “default” mode of thinking. In the default mode, the top or outside part of the brain is very active. Actually, several regions of the brain are interacting in this mode. Some scientists describe this mode as a time when the brain focuses on itself rather than focusing on the environment around the person. Typically, this occurs when a person is doing simple, tedious work or performing routine actions that don’t need much attention, like walking to school or cooking simple foods. People tend to daydream during such activities.<br>The importance of daydreaming lies in developing both creative and social skills. When the mind is not engaged in dealing with one’s immediate situation or problem, then <strong><u>it</u></strong> is free to wander. A time of wandering allows the mind to create things. New inventions may be imagined, or possible solutions to a problem can be planned. For example, solutions for problems in relationships with other people may come to mind. In fact, most daydreams involve situations with others. Perhaps these are daydreams based on memories of the past, or daydreams of what might be in the future. In either case, daydreams help us develop the appropriate skills we can use in real interactions with others.<br>As a neurologist, Dr. Marcus Raichle of Washington University explains: “When you don’t use amuscle, that muscle really isn’t doing much. But when your brain is supposedly doing nothing anddaydreaming, it’s really doing a <strong><u>tremendous</u></strong> amount.” During the so-called “resting state” the brain isn’tresting at all!<br>(Adapted from <i>Reading Challenge 3, Second edition, by Casey Malarcher&Anderea Janzen</i>)",
