Throughout the process, the computer system is guided by humans to ensure that the pieces are accurately rebuilt.

In non- vocational studies, students often spend hours of their time exploring a variety of different subjects. Their class time tends to be only a few hours per week, as they will spend many hours in the library and on computers conducting research and writing papers that help them continue to build their theoretical knowledge in a variety of fields. They have significantly fewer opportunities to actually put these ideas to work compared to students going through a vocational education situation. The skills for work and vocation are significantly limited for these students, as their theoretical knowledge does not have the work experience that helps them¬†<strong><u>transition</u></strong> from a classroom study topic into their actual profession. This can sometimes cause challenges when the students graduate and transition into the working world.<br>However, for students in vocational education and training, this situation gets corrected. Students spend hours in the practical workshops each week learning¬†<strong><u>hands-on</u></strong> practical skills related to their chosen field. Class time tends to increase in these schools, compared to their outside research time, because students spend more time exploring actual work opportunities that prepare¬†<strong><u>them</u></strong> for their future jobs. They do not focus as much time on researching the theoretical as learning the practical.<br>Students also have courses that will help them use the highly specialised equipment that they need to do their jobs well. Rather than simply learning about this type of equipment or how it might be useful in the job, they actually have the chance to try out their own skills while still in school. When the time comes for them to transition to an actual job, they have the experience they need to begin the job right away. They will not have to spend time learning how to physically operate the equipment on the job, allowing them to become a valuable employee and build a career faster.<br><i>Source: https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/vocational-training-career-development</i>",
