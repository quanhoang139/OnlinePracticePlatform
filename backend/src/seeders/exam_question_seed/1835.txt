At the centre, we can discover the  wonders of science and technology in a fun way. Clap your hands and colorful bulbs will light up. Start a wheel spinning and it will set off a fan churning. It is a place to answer our curiosity and capture our imagination.<br>The centre features over four hundred exhibits covering topics like solar radiation, communication, electronics, mathematics, nuclear energy and evolution. <strong><u>It</u></strong> aims to arouse interest in science and technology among us and the general public. The centre is the first science one to be established in South East Asia. It  was opened in 1977 and it now receives an average of one thousand, two hundred visitors a day. The exhibits can be found in four exhibition galleries. They are the Lobby, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences and Aviation. These exhibits are renewed annually so as to encourage visitors to make return visits to the centre.<br>Instead of the usual “Hands off” notices found in exhibition halls, visitors are invited to touch and feel the exhibits, push the buttons, turn the cranks or pedals. This is an interesting way to learn science even if you hate the subject. A Discovery Centre was built for children between the ages of three and twelve. This new exhibition gallery was completed in 1985. Lately this year a stone-age exhibit was built. It shows us about the animals and people which were extinct.",

The infant mortality rate of babies whose mothers have received primary education is half that of children whose mothers are illiterate. In the poorest countries of the world, 50% of girls do not attend secondary school. Yet, research shows that every extra year of school for girls increases their lifetime income by 15%. Improving female education, and thus the earning potential of women, improves the standard of living for their own children, as women invest more of their income in their families than men do. Yet, many <strong><u>barriers</u></strong> to education for girls remain. In some African countries, such as Burkina Faso, girls are unlikely to attend school for such basic reasons as a lack of private latrine facilities for girls.<br>Higher attendance rates of high schools and university education among women, particularly in developing countries, have helped them <strong><u>make inroads to</u></strong> professional careers with better-paying salaries and wages.  Education increases a woman's (and her partner and the family's) level of health and health awareness.<br>Furthering women's levels of education and advanced training also tends to lead to later ages of initiation of  sexual activity and first intercourse, later age at first marriage, and later age at first childbirth, as well as an increased likelihood to remain single, have no children, or have no formal marriage and alternatively, have increasing levels of long-term partnerships. <strong><u>It</u></strong> can lead to higher rates of barrier and chemical contraceptive  use (and a lower level of sexually transmitted infections among women and their partners and children), and  can increase the level of resources available to women who divorce or are in a situation of domestic violence.<br>It has been shown, in addition, to increase women's communication with their partners and their employers,  and to improve rates of civic participation such as voting or the holding of office.",
