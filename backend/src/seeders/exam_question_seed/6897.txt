Located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in 1959 the islands became the 50 th state of the U.S. Of all the Hawaiian Islands, Kauai is the best place for vacation as it is called a tropical paradise. With increasing tourist attraction, its population is getting higher especially in hot seasons. Because thick green rainforests cover the island, the air makes your skin soft and smooth. There is little air pollution here, and no stress. The beaches of Kauai are large part of its beauty; they are all peaceful clean white sands. If you want to meet colourful undersea creatures, you will have to take a short course for diving. You need an enrolment to get training from professional divers. They also make wide explanations for the characteristics of the ocean. As soon as you make up your mind, reserve your place, buy your ticket and say goodbye to your stressful city!",
