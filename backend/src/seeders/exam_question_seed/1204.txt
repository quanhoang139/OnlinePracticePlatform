Even though they have wings, they cannot fly. Instead, ostriches have long, powerful legs that help them to run very fast when they feel <strong><u>threatened</u></strong>. Ostriches use their wings to move themselves forward and to help them change direction.<br>Ostriches are native to Africa, where they still live in desert areas and dry, open grasslands called savannah. Ostriches can also be found in zoos all over the world. Humans have domesticated ostriches, so now ostriches live on farms in over a dozen countries, including the United States, China, India, Japan, Brazil and Costa Rica. They are raised for their meat, skin, and feathers.<br>Ostriches like to live in small groups called herds. The male ostrich is called a rooster; the female, a hen. Baby ostriches are called chicks.
