Buckingham Palace has spoken of the Queen’s “deep sorrow” after her husband of 73 years, who had been by her side throughout her reign, died peacefully at Windsor Castle aged 99 on Friday night (Australian time).<br>Flags at Buckingham Palace and government buildings across the United Kingdom were lowered to half-mast, and within an hour of the announcement the public began to lay flowers outside Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. However, <strong><u>mourners</u></strong> have been urged not to gather and leave tributes at royal residences, and the public has been asked to stay away from funeral events because of the coronavirus pandemic. An online book of condolence has been launched on the Royal Family’s official website for people to leave messages of sympathy.<br>The prince died two months short of his 100th birthday. He had recently spent four weeks in hospital with an infection where he was treated for a heart condition before being <strong><u>discharged</u></strong> and returned to Windsor early in March. The Duke of Edinburgh had been by his wife’s side throughout her 69-year reign, the longest in British history, and during that time earned a reputation for a tough, no-nonsense attitude, and a propensity for occasional gaffes. A Greek prince, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947, and together <strong><u>they</u></strong> had four children, eight grandchildren, and nine great grandchildren. He played a key role helping the monarchy adapt to a changing world in the post-World War II period, and behind the walls of Buckingham Palace was the one key figure the Queen could trust and turn to, knowing he could tell her exactly what he thought.<br><i>(Adapted from Select Readings by Linda Lee and Jean Bernard)</i>",
