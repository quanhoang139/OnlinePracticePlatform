It is very special to a rather big family like mine. I realize how much Mother has done for years, and all the wonderful things she has done for her children. So this year Father, my two sisters and I. the only boy in the family, decided to make Mother’s Day a special occasion for our Mother. Father took a holiday from his office; my sisters and I came home from school after lunch. We planned to make it a day just like Christmas. We decorated the house with colorful flowers, candles and a small greeting over the fireplace. Mother usually did so at Christmas by herself. My sisters dressed themselves in their best. Father wore the new tie that Mother had bought for him on his birthday. I was so excited with the idea that I was the person who bought Mother a new silk hat from the money Father had secretly given to me before. We wanted to give Mother a big surprise. We hired a motor car which would take US all for a beautiful drive into the country nearby. Mother rarely had a treat like that. She is busy cooking and cleaning almost all the time. And of course, the country would be so lovely, the driving over miles of greenery in the country would be specially exciting to Mother. Mother deserved them all.",
