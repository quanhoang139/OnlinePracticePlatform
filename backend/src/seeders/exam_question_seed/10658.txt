Most risks fall into these categories: peer-to-peer; lack of understanding of online privacy issues; and the influences of advertisers. Although \"online harassment\" is often used interchangeably with the term \"cyberbullying\", is actually different. Research suggests that online harassment is not as common as offline harassment, and participation in social networking sites does not put most children at risk of online harassment. Cyberbullying is using digital media to communicate false, embarrassing, or unfriendly information about another person. <strong>It </strong>is the most common online risk for all teens, and can have profound emotional effects.<br>Researchers have introduced a new phenomenon called \"Facebook depression\", defined as depression that develops when youngsters spend a lot of time on social media sites and then begin to show classic expression of depression. The power of the online world is thought to be a factor that may cause depression in some adolescents. As with offline depression, young people who suffer from Facebook depression are at risk of social isolation and sometimes turn to risky internet sites for \"help\". The main risks to young people online today are each other, risks of improper use of technology, lack of privacy, or posting false information about themselves or others. These types of behaviour threaten their privacy.<br>When people go onto websites, they can leave evidence of their visits. This ongoing record of online activity is called the \"<strong>digital footprint</strong>\". One of the biggest threats to young people on social media sites  is to their digital footprint and future reputations. Young people who lack an awareness of privacy issues often post inappropriate material without understanding that \"what goes online stays online\". As a result, future jobs and college acceptance may be put at risk of inexperienced clicks of the mouse.<br><i>                                          (Adapted from Cambridge English Compact by Simon Haines)</i>",

And is what they learn the sort of thing they should be learning? It is my belief that children should not just be acquiring knowledge of animals but also developing attitudes and feelings towards them based on exposure to the real lives of animals in their natural habitats. But is this happening?<br>Some research in this area indicates that it is not. Learning about animals in school is often completely <strong>disconnected</strong> from the real lives of real animals, with the result that children often end up with little or no understanding or lasting knowledge of them. <strong>They</strong> learn factual information about animals, aimed at enabling them to identify them and have various abstract ideas about them, but that is the extent of their learning. Children’s storybooks tend to personify animals as characters rather than teach about them.<br>For direct contact with wild and international animals, the only opportunity most children have is visiting a zoo. The educational benefit of this for children is often given as the main reason for doing it but research has shown that zoo visits seldom add to children’s knowledge of animals - the animals are simply like exhibits in a museum that the children look at without engaging with them as living creatures. Children who belong to wildlife or environmental organizations or who watch wildlife TV programmes, however, show significantly higher knowledge than any other group of children studied in research. The studies show that if children learn about animals in their natural habitats, particularly through wildlife-based activities, they know more about them than they do as a result of visiting zoos or learning about them in the classroom.<br>Research has also been done into the attitudes of children towards animals. It shows that in general terms, children form strong attachments to individual animals, usually their pets, but do not have strong feelings for animals in general. This attitude is the norm regardless of the amount or kind of learning about animals they have at school. However, those children who watch television wildlife programs show an interest in and affection for wildlife in its natural environment, and their <strong>regard</strong> for animals in general is higher.<br><i><strong>(</strong></i>Adapted from<i><strong> New English File</strong></i>, by Christina Latham -Koenig, Oxford University Press)",
