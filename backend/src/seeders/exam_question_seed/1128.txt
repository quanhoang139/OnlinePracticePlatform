A recent report which examined in detail the reading habit of primary school children, showed that even seven-year-old boys and girls have clear views about what they want to read. Girls, in general, read more and far more girls than boys preferred reading stories. Boys were showing a taste for the more instant appeal of picture stories, or else books about their hobbies. These tastes continue unchanged until the children are teenagers. Apparently, girls read more in general, but more fiction in particular. You could say that there are more opportunities for girls to read fiction: magazines encourage the fiction habit in girls in <strong>their</strong> early teens, and by their late teens they have probably moved on to the adult women’s magazines. Teenage boys tend to buy magazines about their hobbies: motorcycles, heavy transport and so on.",
