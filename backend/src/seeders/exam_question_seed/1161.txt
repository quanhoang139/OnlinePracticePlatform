About 2.6 billion people globally - 38% of the world population - are already overweight or obese. But on current trends that is expected to rise to more titan 4 billion people (51%) in 12 years’ time, according to research by the World Obesity Federation.<br>Obesity among children and young people is likely to increase faster than <strong><u>that </u></strong>among adults. By 2035 it is expected to be at least double the rate seen in 2020 - it will rise by 100% among boys under 18, but go up even more sharply, by 125%, among girls the same age. Switzerland, Norway, Finland, Iceland and Sweden are among the best prepared countries to deal with obesity while Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and Central African Republic are examples of the world’s poorest countries that are the least prepared. Professor Louise Baur, the federation’s president, says that the sharpest increases in obesity will be seen in low- and middle-income countries where lack of preparedness and resources will create a perfect storm that will negatively impact obese people the most.<br>The rising obesity globally is caused by factors such as climate change. Covid restrictions and chemical pollutants, as well as the promotion of unhealthy foods. It is suggested that governments should <strong><u>restrict</u></strong> the marketing of foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar, and provide healthy food in schools.",
