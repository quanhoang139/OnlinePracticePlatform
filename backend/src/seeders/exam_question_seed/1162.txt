Music can also help you relax and feel more lively.<br>To cheer up or boost your energy, listen to Latin music or anything with a strong beat, lots of percussion, and a fast tempo. When you want to relax after a busy day, music with string instruments and woodwinds, less percussion, and a slower tempo can calm you.<br>Listening to calming music before you start any stressful activities, advises Dr. Clair. “Once you’re in a good stale of mind, it’s easier to maintain it.” You can lower stress at work with music, too, by playing relaxing tunes. But only play them when you really need them. You can change your mood by switching from one kind of music to another. For example, first play some nice gentle ballads, and then listen to something more energetic. When you want to calm down after a busy week at work, just do the opposite.",
