Made a shopping list? Blown your nose into a tissue? Taken some medicine? Have you once looked around and made a list of things that have forest origin? Forests play a vital part in our daily lives in more ways than we can imagine.<br>     Over 1.5 billion people rely on forests for livelihoods. Forests provide us with shelter,<br>livelihoods, water, food and fuel security. All of these activities directly or indirectly involve forests. Some are easy to figure out – fruits, paper and wood from trees, and so on. Others are less obvious, such as by-products that go into everyday items like medicines, cosmetics and detergents.<br>     We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use. Forests provide ecosystem services that are <strong><u>critical</u></strong> to human welfare. They absorb harmful greenhouse gasses <strong><u>that</u></strong> produce climate change. They protect watersheds, prevent soil erosion and reduce the amount of chemicals that reach waterways. Forests serve as a buffer in natural disasters like flood and rainfalls and provide habitat to more than half of the world’s land-based species<br>Yet, despite our dependence on forests, we are still allowing them to disappear. Between 1990 and 2020, the world lost some 178 million hectares of forests, an area the size of Libya. When we take away the forest, it is not just the trees that go. The entire ecosystem begins to fall apart, with <strong><u>dire</u></strong> consequences for all of us.<br>(Adapted from wwf.panda.org)",
