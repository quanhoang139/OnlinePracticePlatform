Water resources like  these are called surface water. The most <i><strong>obvious </strong></i>type of water pollution affects surface waters. For example, a  spill from an oil tanker creates an oil slick that can affect a vast area of the ocean. However, not all of Earth’s  water flows on its surface. A great deal of water is held in underground rock structures known as aquifers,  which we cannot see and seldom think about. Water store underground in aquifers is known as groundwater.  Aquifers feed our rivers and supply much of our drinking water. They too can become polluted, for example,  when weed killers used in people’s gardens drain into the ground. Groundwater pollution is much less obvious  than surface-water pollution, but is no less of a problem. A study in Iowa in the United States found that over  half the state’s groundwater wells were contaminated with weed killers.<br>Surface waters and groundwater are the two types of water resources that pollution affects. There are also  two different ways in which pollution can occur. If pollution comes from a single location, such as a discharge  pipe attached to a factory, it is known as point source pollution. Other examples of source pollution include an  oil spill from a tanker or someone pouring oil from their car down a drain. A great deal of water pollution  happens not from single source but from many scattered sources. This is called non-point source pollution.<br>Sometimes pollution that enters the environment in one place has an effect hundreds or even thousands of  miles away. This is known as trans-boundary pollution. One example is the way radioactive waste travels  through the oceans from nuclear reprocessing plants in England and France to nearby countries such as  Ireland and Norway.<br>(Source: <u>http://www.algopumps.com</u>)",
