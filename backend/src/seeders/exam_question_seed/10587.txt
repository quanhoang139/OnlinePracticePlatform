Ông ta đã khiến nhiều người tức giận và Catherine biết rằng phải làm gì đó. Bà ấy rất thông minh và làm việc chăm chỉ để nhận được sự ủng hộ của quân đội Nga. Năm 1762, bà lãnh đạo một cuộc đảo chính chống lại Peter III và bà trở thành Hoàng hậu Nga.<br>Catherine II là một nhà lãnh đạo rất quyền lực và bà đã cai trị nước Nga trong 34 năm.

Hơn nữa, Catherine II cũng rất quan tâm đến nghệ thuật và văn hóa. Bà đã mời nhiều nghệ sĩ, nhà văn nổi tiếng đến Nga. Bà cũng là bạn tốt của Voltaire, một triết gia nổi tiếng người Pháp. Họ đã viết nhiều bức thư cho nhau, và Voltaire thậm chí còn dành tặng một số tác phẩm của mình cho Catherine II. Thật không may, Catherine II qua đời năm 1796 ở tuổi 67. Bà là một nhà lãnh đạo rất quan trọng và đã tạo ra nhiều thay đối tích cực cho nước Nga. Bà sẽ luôn được nhớ đến như một trong những nhà cai trị vĩ đại nhất trong lịch sử nước Nga.",
