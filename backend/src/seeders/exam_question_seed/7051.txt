Young people are usually more willing to talk if they believe that questions are asked out of real interest and not because people are trying to check up on them. Parents should do their best to talk to their son or daughter about school work and future plans but should not push them to talk if they don't want to. Parents should also watch for the danger signs: some young people in trying to be adult may experiment with alcohol or smoking. Parents need to watch for any signs of unusual behavior which may be connected with these and get help if necessary.",
