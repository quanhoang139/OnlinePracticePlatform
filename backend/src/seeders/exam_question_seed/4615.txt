They are also trying to do so many tasks to balance study, relaxation and friends.<br>   There are different ways of dealing with stress. A good way to deal with stress is to exercise. Research has proved that physical exercise is a good release for stress, because it increases certain chemicals in the brain which calm people down. Getting enough sleep is also an important way of avoiding stress and staying healthy and full of energy. Another way to avoid stress is by managing time effectively. It is better to do several tasks really well than performing too many tasks badly. Finally, if it all gets beyond their control, teenagers shouldn’t worry. Find the time to sit down quietly and breathe deeply for ten to twenty minutes. Do this regularly, and it will help them calm down and put things in order.",
