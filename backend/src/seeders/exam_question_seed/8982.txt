In English, at least three have been identified and described. Standard usage includes those words and expressions understood, used, and accepted by a majority of the speakers of a language in any situation regardless of the level of formality. As such, these words and expression are well defined and listed in standard dictionaries. Colloquialisms, on the other hand, are familiar words and idioms that are understood by almost all speakers of a language and used in informal speed or writing, but not considered acceptable for more formal situations. Almost all idiomatic expressions are colloquial language. Slang, refers to words and expressions understood by a large number of speakers but not accepted as <strong>appropriate</strong> formal usage by the majority.  <br>      Colloquial expressions and even slang may be found in standard dictionaries but will be so identified. Both colloquial usage and slang are more common in speech than writing. Colloquial speech often passes into standard speech. Some slang also passes into standard speech, but other slang expressions enjoy momentary popularity followed by <strong>obscurity</strong>. In some cases, the majority never accepts certain slang phrases but nevertheless retains <strong>them</strong> in their collective memories. Every generation seems to require its own set of words to describe familiar objects and events.It has been pointed out by a number of linguists that three cultural conditions are necessary for the creation of a large body of slang expressions. First, the introduction and acceptance of new objects and situations in the society; second, a diverse population with a large number of subgroups; third, association among the subgroups and the majority population.<br>      Finally, it is worth noting that the terms \"standard\", \"colloquial\", and \"slang\" exist only as abstract labels for scholars who study language. Only a tiny number of the speakers of any language will be aware that they are using colloquial or slang expressions. Most speakers of English will, during appropriate situations, select and use three types of expressions.<br><i>(Source: TOEFL Reading)</i>",

If there were no diseases, the population would grow too quickly, and there would not be enough food or other resources, so in a way, diseases are natural ways of keeping the Earth in balance. But sometimes they spread very quickly and kill large numbers of people. For example, in 1918, an outbreak of the flu spread across the world, killing over 25 million people in only six months. Such terrible outbreaks of a disease are called <strong>pandemics</strong>. <br>    Pandemics happen when a disease changes in a way that our bodies are not prepared to fight. In 1918, a new type of flu virus appeared. Our bodies had no way to fight this new flu virus, and so <strong>it</strong> spread very quickly and killed large numbers of people. While there have been many different pandemic diseases throughout history, all of them have a new thing in common.<br>   First, all pandemic diseases spread from one person to another very easily.<br>   Second, while they may kill many people, they generally do not kill people very quickly. A good example of this would be the Marburg virus. The Marburg virus is an extremely infectious disease. In addition, it is deadly. About %(70-80 \\%)% of all people who get the Marburg virus died from the disease. However, the Marburg virus has not become a pandemic because most people die within three days of getting the disease. This means that the virus does not have enough time to spread a large number of people. The flu virus of 1918 , on the other hand, generally took about a week to ten days to kill its victims, so it had more time to spread.<br>    While we may never be able to completely stop pandemics, we can make them less common. Doctors carefully <strong>monitor</strong> new diseases that they fear could become pandemics. For example, in 2002, and 2003, doctors carefully watched SARS. Their health warnings may have prevented SARS from becoming a pandemic.<br><i>                                                                                                                      (Source: TOEFL Reading)</i>",
