You know the obvious behaviors that describe someone who is healthy and takes care of themselves. A healthy person doesn't smoke, eats healthy foods with plenty of fruits, vegetables and fiber and, of course, exercises regularly. A healthy person also knows how to manage stress, gets good quality sleep each night, doesn't drink too much, doesn't sit too much, does everything in moderation all the time. When you look at everything that could possibly make a healthy lifestyle, you can see just how hard all of those things are in our current world.<br>There is no such thing as a \"bad\" food, but there are some foods you should try not to have regular basis. Fast food refers to food that can be prepared and served quickly. It is popular as the food is inexpensive, convenient, and tastes good. Because fast food is high in sodium, trans-fat, and cholesterol, <strong><u>it</u> </strong>isn't something you should eat often.<br>The good news is that you don't have to change everything at the same time. In fact, the <strong><u>trick</u> </strong>to healthy living is making small changes-taking more steps each day, adding fruit to your cereal, having an extra glass of water, or saying no to that second helping of buttery mashed potatoes. One thing you can do right now to make your lifestyle healthier is to move more.",
