A guide for high school students</strong><br>If you're currently in secondary school, you may be interested in getting a job during your summer break. However, you may not know how to find a summer job. Here is some useful advice for you.<br>Firstly, you should find out when your school will close for the summer. Then you should plan to apply for jobs two to three months before the start of your summer break. This can help ensure that you have a job already lined up when summer arrives. Secondly, you should prepare an application letter for the job you want to apply for. You may have to change each application letter for every specific job to increase your chances of moving further in the hiring process. For example, your application letter for a shop assistant may highlight different qualifications than the one for a home tutor to a young child.<br>Lastly, you should prepare for the job interview. If an employer is interested in hiring you, they may ask you for an interview. Before the interview, prepare for some questions that the interviewer is likely to ask you, such as why you want the position and what relevant skills you have. On the day of the interview, bring printed copies of your CV and application letter in case the employer wants to review them. You should also wear a professional outfit and try to be positive and friendly during your interview.<br>(Adapted from Tieng Anh 12 – Global Success)",

There are usually five main steps in writing a good biography.<br><strong>1. Choose a</strong> <strong><u>subject</u></strong>. Choosing the person you want to write about is, of course, the first step. This could be a celebrity, or someone who is lesser known. You could also write about someone who is still alive or someone who is dead. Most importantly, choose a person who has had an impact on other people, or whose life is interesting.<br>2. <strong>Get permission</strong>. Although you can still write about a person's life without his or her permission, it is always better to get the subject's agreement. <strong><u>This</u></strong> will not only help you in your research, but you will also avoid upsetting the person later on if he or she thinks your account is not true.<br>3. <strong>Do your research</strong>. You can obtain information through primary sources, e.g. the subject's letters or other personal writings, and interviews with her or him. You can also use secondary sources prepared by someone who didn't know the subject or published at a later time.<br>4. <strong>Choose a format</strong>. A biography is usually told in chronological or time order. However, you may also choose to organise the events by themes or specific achievements.<br>5. <strong>Outline, write, and edit</strong>. It's a good idea to start with a detailed outline including your main points and the number of chapters. After that, write your first draft. Then revise and edit it until you've got a final version you are happy with.<br>Writing a biography is not easy, but it is worth the effort. A biography often influences or<br>motivates people, and teaches valuable life lessons.<br>(Adapted from Tieng Anh 12 – Global Success)",
