Scientists previously believed that the series of extinctions happened over a period of 15 to 20 million years. Recent discoveries in Nova Scotia suggest, however, that the extinctions may have happened over a much shorter period of time, perhaps less than 850,000 years.<br>     Evidence for a rapid extinction of species at the end of the Triassic Period is found in the McCoy Brook Formation along the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. Fossils found in this formation indicate a rapid disappearance of species rather than a slow and gradual change over time. One explanation for a relatively sudden extinction at the end of the Triassic may be that a large meteorite <strong>struck</strong> the earth at the time and is responsible for a 70- kilometer hole nearby. If geologists and other researchers can find evidence, such as shocked quartz in the rock formations, that a meteorite did strike the earth, it would give more credence to the theory of rapid Triassic extinctions. It is possible, however, that even if a rapid extinction happened in and around Nova Scotia, it did not necessarily occur in the rest of the world.<br><br>- meteorite: <i>thiên thạch</i>",
