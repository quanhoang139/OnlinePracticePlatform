It provides you incredible benefits that come with the backing of science! One of the most useful languages to learn is English. Learning a second language is one of the best ways to keep your brain active and challenged. Learning another language offers important cognitive benefits at any age, helping to keep the mind active and even reducing the risk of mental disease and slowing mental decline later in life. When learning English as a second language, you approach new ways to think and express yourself through written and spoken words. Learning multiple languages can help you communicate more clearly in any language as you learn more about how language itself works and how to use it to promote ideas and reach out to others in a variety of social and work situations. The world may not have a global language, but English is the default option for countless forms of communication across the globe. That’s why one of the benefits of learning English is that it significantly boosts your hiring potential. In addition, it can offer you educational opportunities. If you desire access to some of the best schools like Harvard, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge or MIT, then knowing English provides you an incredible <strong><u>edge</u></strong>. It’s expected that around 2 billion people around the world will learn English over the next decade.​",
