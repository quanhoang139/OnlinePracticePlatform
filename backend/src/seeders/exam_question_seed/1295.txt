The City is small in area but it is the commercial heart of London. Many banks and offices are situated there. St. Paul’s Cathedral in the City is very large and beautiful. It was designed in the late 17th century by Sir Christopher Wren, one of the most famous English architects, and was completed in 1710. If the City is called the commercial heart of London, Westminster is the center of the administration. We can see the houses of Parliament there. The West End with the best and most expensive clubs, restaurants and theaters, beautiful houses and parks is the place where rich people live. Working people live the East End, where there are no parks or gardens and no fine houses.",
