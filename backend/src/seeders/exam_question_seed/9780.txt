According to several leading educational psychologists, this is one of the biggest mistakes which some parents make. Generally, the child will understand very well what the parents expect. And will fail. Unrealistic parental expectations can cause great damage to the children. However, if parents are not unrealistic about what they expect their children to do, but are hopeful in sensible way, the child may succeed in doing very well especially if the parents are very supportive of their children.<br>Michael Smiths is very lucky. He is very fond of music, and his parents help him a lot by taking him to concerts and arranging private piano and violin lessons. Although Michael’s father plays the trumpet in a large orchestra, he never makes Michael enter music competitions if he is unwilling.<br>Michael’s friend, Winston Maier. However, is not so lucky. As both of his parents are successful musicians, they set too high a standard for Winston. They want their son to be as successful as they are, and so they enter him in every piano competition held. They are very unhappy when he does not win. “When I was at your age, I used to win every competition I enter.” Winston’s father tells him. Winston is always afraid that he will disappoint his parents and now he always seems quiet and unhappy.",
