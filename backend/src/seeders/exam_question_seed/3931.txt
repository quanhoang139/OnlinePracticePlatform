An American professor discovered the difference while teaching a  class in a Brazilian university. The two-hour class was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m and end at 12 p.m. On the first  day, when the professor arrived on time, no one was in the classroom. Many students came after 10 a.m. Several  arrived after 10:30 a.m. Two students came after 11 a.m. Although all the students greeted the professor as they  arrived, few apologized for their lateness. Were these students being rude? He decided to study the students’  behavior.<br>The professor talked to American and Brazilian students about lateness in both an informal and a formal  situation: lunch with a friend and in a university class, respectively. He gave them an example and asked them how  they would react. If they had a lunch appointment with a friend, the average American student defined lateness as  19 minutes after the agreed time. On the other hand, the average Brazilian student felt the friend was late after 33  minutes.<br>In an American university, students are expected to arrive at the appointed hour. In contrast, in Brazil, neither  the teacher nor the students always arrive at the appointed hour. Classes not only begin at the scheduled time in the  United States, but they also end at the scheduled time. In the Brazilian class, only a few students left the class at  noon; many remained past 12:30 p.m to discuss the class and ask more questions. While arriving late may not be  very important in Brazil, neither is staying late.<br>The explanation for these differences is complicated. People from Brazilian and North American cultures have  different feelings about lateness. In Brazil, the students believe that a person who usually arrives late is probably  more successful than a person who is always on time. In fact, Brazilians expect a person with status or prestige to  arrive late, while in the United States lateness is usually considered to be disrespectful and unacceptable.  Consequently, if a Brazilian is late for an appointment with a North American, the American may misinterpret the  reason for the lateness and become angry.<br>(Source: https://www.communicaid.com)",
