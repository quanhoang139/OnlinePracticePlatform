In a recent issue of the Journal of Comparative Psychology (Vol. 117, No. 3), the research group published the first study of giant panda cub-rearing and separation. The study is the first step in examining the impact of a common breeding practice in China: separating captive cubs before they are six months old so that the mothers will be able to reproduce again sooner. Cubs in the wild stay with their mothers for 1.5 to 2.5 years.<br>Snyder and her co-authors, including Maple and psychologist Mollie Bloomsmith, PhD, theorize that separating cubs from their mothers too early may harm their social development, and could <strong>underlie</strong> why so many captive pandas fail to breed. Captive males often show little sexual interest in females or are too aggressive.<br>The research team has also <strong>conducted</strong> urinary and behavioral analyses of female giant pandas during the breeding season, which is generally in the spring, and is examining the behavior of giant panda mothers. Graduate student Megan Wilson, who also has worked in Chengdu, is investigating sequences of play-fighting for her dissertation. And former graduate student and Chengdu researcher Loraine Tarou, PhD, examined giant panda cognition.<br>Tarou, now an assistant professor at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, is the first to examine how captive pandas forage for food and learn to adapt to changes in their environment. She compared her findings with the cognition of the spectacled bear and found that while both use spatial memory to find food, the spectacled bears used visual cues the pandas did not pick up on.<br>The finding indicates that giant pandas' reliance on spatial memory alone may cause <strong>them</strong> to have difficulty when their food sources are <strong>abruptly</strong> changed or moved--a big problem for an animal that consumes nearly 30 pounds of bamboo a day.<br>While such basic research may not have immediate application, says Tarou, it is contributing to scientists' growing knowledge of the species.",

The young German spoke about <strong>deforestation</strong> and its effect on the planet. At the end of his talk, he challenged the people of his country to help by planting one million trees. Nobody thought much would come of a nine-year-old's school project. Before he was 20, however, Finkbeiner's efforts had resulted in the planting of more than 14 billion trees around the world.<br>Finkbeiner and his classmates began the project - named \"Plant-for-the-Planet\" - by planting the first tree outside their school. Other schools followed the example, and news of the one-million challenge spread. As a result, Finkbeiner was asked to speak at the European Parliament. Other invitations soon followed, and when he was just 13, he spoke at a United Nations conference in New York. \"We cannot trust that adults alone will save our future,\" he said in the speech. \"We have to take our future in our hands.\"<br>Finkbeiner is now in his twenties, and Plant-for-the-Planet is an organization with around 70,000 members. <strong>It</strong> works to teach people about climate change and to encourage the planting of more trees. Germany's one millionth tree was planted long ago. The goal now is one trillion - 150 for every person on Earth.",
