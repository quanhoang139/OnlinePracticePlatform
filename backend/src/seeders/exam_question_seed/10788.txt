In Rochester, New York, she began her first public crusade on behalf of temperance, the habit of not drinking alcohol. The temperance movement dealt with the abuses of women and children who suffered from alcoholic husbands. Also, she worked tirelessly against slavery and for women’s rights. Anthony helped write the history of woman suffrage.<br>At the time Anthony lived, women did not have the right to vote. Because she voted in the 1872 election, a US official arrested Anthony. She hoped to prove that women had the legal right to vote under the provisions of the 14 th and 15 th Amendments to the Constitution. At her trial, a hostile federal judge found her guilty and fined her $100, which she refused to pay.<br>Anthony did not work alone. She worked with reformers of women’s rights such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Amelia Bloomer. Susan worked for the American Anti-Slavery Society with Frederick Douglas, a fugitive slave and black abolitionist.<br>On July 2 nd 1979, the US Mint honored her by issuing the Susan Anthony dollar coin. Although Anthony did not live to see the fruits of her efforts, the establishment of the 19 th Amendment is <strong><u>indebted</u> </strong>to her efforts, according to US historians.",

It can be connected to one or more laptops, PCs, tablets, or other electronic devices. Smart boards are extremely useful in a classroom because they can engage students, provide interactive opportunities that a traditional whiteboard, blackboard or flip chart can't, and can also develop students' computer skills along with their English skills.<br>Smart boards also have touch-screen technology so you do not actually need a computer to access the basic functionality. You can write on a smart board with special pens which are usually provided with the board, and anything written on the board can be saved for future reference, or printed out. It is great, for example, if you are doing a brainstorming session or a mind map with your classmates and you want to keep a record of it.<br>If you don't want to draw with the pens, you can use a keyboard and type onto a programme such as Word, and have it appear on the screen for everyone to see. This is great if you are doing an exercise with your class and you want everyone to be able to see the answers during the checkingstage. You can also run PowerPoint presentations on an interactive whiteboard. These can sometimes be great for grammar or vocabulary presentations and the advantage of them is that students can make contributions.<br>If you have the Internet access, you can access websites and put them onto a white board. This is great in an English classroom if you have online quizzes or games you want to use. Students can actually come up to the board and select their answers. This involves them directly in the board work, which they usually love. You can also run video clips or sound files from the Internet, or some which are saved on your computer.<br>In short, a smart board can make the lessons more varied, and can give students a more active role in the lesson.",
