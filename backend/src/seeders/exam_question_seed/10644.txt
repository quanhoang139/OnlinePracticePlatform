It's eighteen metres long, six metres wide and it weighs about twelve thousand kilogrammes. It carries a crew of six people and has an average speed of five knots. However, once you get near to the Plastiki you realise there's a big difference. It's made of twelve thousand five hundred re-used plastic bottles. <br>     David de Rothschild is an environmentalist who has crossed Antarctica and explored the Ecuadorian Amazon. One day he was reading some information about all the plastic in the seas and oceans. He couldn't believe what he was reading. For example, humans throw away four out of every five plastic bottles <strong>they</strong> use, and plastic rubbish causes about eighty per cent of the pollution in the sea. In addition, scientists think that around one million seabirds die every year from plastic pollution. De Rothschild decided he wanted to help <strong>fight</strong> pollution in the sea. To help more people understand the problem, he started building a boat made of plastic bottles.<br>     As well as building the boat with recycled plastic, it was important for him to make the boat environmentally friendly and user-friendly. The boat uses renewable energy such as wind power and solar energy. The crew can make meals with vegetables from the small garden at the back of the boat.<br>     They can take a break from work and get some exercise by using the special exercise bicycle. The energy from the bike provides power for the boat's computers. And if anyone needs to take a shower, the boat's shower uses saltwater from the sea.<br>(Adapted from Life by John Hughes, <i>Helen Stephenson and Paul Dummett</i>)",

        "group_content": "<strong>Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the following questions from 34 to 40.</strong><br><br>   The change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to <strong>exceed</strong> 1.5°C, most simulations suggest. The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5°C by the end of this century. Temperature rises of 2°C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that limiting temperature rises to 1.5°C is safer.<br>   An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5°C target would require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. <br>  The UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions for as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise. China emits more CO2 than any other country. <strong>It</strong> is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there. But even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere.<br>   As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, <strong>uptake</strong> of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs. Global warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. <br>   Responding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century. As the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.",
