The young German spoke about <strong>deforestation</strong> and its effect on the planet. At the end of his talk, he challenged the people of his country to help by planting one million trees. Nobody thought much would come of a nine-year-old’s school project. Before he was 20, however, Finkbeiner’s efforts had resulted in the planting of more than 14 billion trees around the world.<br>Finkbeiner and his classmates began the project - named “Plant-for-the-Planet” - by planting the first tree outside their school. Other schools followed the example, and news of the one-million challenge spread. As a result, Finkbeiner was asked to speak at the European Parliament. Other invitations soon followed, and when he was just 13, he spoke at a United Nations conference in New York. “We cannot trust that adults alone will save our future,” he said in the speech. “We have to take our future in our hands.”<br>Finkbeiner is now in his twenties, and Plant-for-the-Planet is an organization with around 70,000 members. <strong><u>It</u></strong> works to teach people about climate change and to encourage the planting of more trees. Germany’s one millionth tree was planted long ago. The goal now is one trillion - 150 for every person on Earth.<br><i>(Adapted from Reading Explorer by Becky Tarver Chase and David Bohlke)</i>",

Others are looking for culture, or simply want to have their pictures taken in front of famous places. But most European tourists are looking for a sunny beach to lie on. Northern Europeans are willing to pay a lot of money and put up with a lot of inconveniences for the sun because <strong><u>they</u></strong> have so little of it. Residents of cities like London, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam spend a lot of their winter in the dark because the days are so short, and much of the rest of the year in the rain. This is the reason why the Mediterranean has always attracted them. Every summer, more than 25 million people travel to Mediterranean resorts and beaches for their vacation. They all come for the same reason, sun!<br>The huge crowds mean lots of money for the economies of Mediterranean countries. Italy's 30,000 hotels are booked <strong><u>solid</u></strong> every summer. And 13 million people camp out on French beaches, parks and roadsides. Spain's long sandy coastline attracts more people than anywhere else. 37 million tourists visit yearly, or one tourist for every person living in Spain.<br>But there are signs that the area is getting more tourists than it can <strong><u>handle.</u></strong> The Mediterranean is already one of the most polluted seas on earth. And with increased tourism, it's getting worse. The French can't figure out what to do with all the garbage left by campers around St. Tropez. And in many places, swimming is dangerous because of pollution. None of this, however, is spoiling anyone's fun. The Mediterranean gets more popular every year with tourists. Obviously, they don't go there for clean water and solitude. They tolerate traffic jams and seem to like crowded beaches. They don't even mind the pollution. No matter how dirty the water is, the coastline still looks beautiful. And as long as the sun shines, it's still better than sitting in the cold rain in Berlin, London, or Oslo.<br><i>(Adapted from</i> \"<i><strong>Subject Link L8</strong></i>\")",
