It is sold in 80 countries and comes in 26 different languages. But where did this classic board game come from, and why did it become so popular? At the beginning of the 20th century, an instructional game called <i>‘The Landlord's</i> Game’ was first published by a political activist, Elizabeth Magie. The purpose of the game was to teach people how rich, powerful individuals take advantage of the poor while they accumulate even more wealth. Unfortunately, the game was not popular, and she sold very few copies of <strong><u>it</u>.</strong><br>In 1934, a man called Charles Darrow redesigned it, creating a game of chance. However, when he presented his game, which he called \"Monopoly, \" to the games manufacturers Parker Brothers, they rejected it. They said it was too complex and contained too many <strong><u>flaws</u>.</strong><br>Darrow persisted and decided to produce the game himself. He created and sold over 5,000 handmade sets to a local department store. The game had immense public appeal, and was so popular that Darrow went back to Parker Brothers, who bought the rights to the game.<br>(Adapted from <i>Complete IELTS</i> by Rawdon Wyatt)",

It is estimated that since the 1950s, as much as fifteen percent of Alaska’s land area has disappeared. How can a whole state be disappearing? The problem is that Alaska’s glaciers are melting. The state has more than 100,000 glaciers. These glaciers account for about 75,000 square kilometers, or five percent, of the state’s area. That is an area of land larger than Ireland!<br>According to a recent report by the US Geological Survey, ninty-nine percent of Alaska’s glaciers are either retreating or <strong><u>diminishing</u>. </strong>This diminishing seems mainly due to the increase in global temperatures. Since the 1960s, the average year-round temperature has increased by almost <strong>3°c. </strong>Additionally, the average winter temperature has increased by over 6°c. Presently, an estimated 100 cubic kilometers of ice is disappearing from Alaskan glaciers every year. It may be even more in the near future, as some scientists predict that the average world temperature could go up 4 to 7°c by the year 2100.<br>Another problem facing Alaska is its thawing permafrost. Much of the land in Alaska used to be permanently frozen or frozen for most of the year. Now, the thawing permafrost is causing a number of problems for people living in Alaska. Roads and utility poles are collapsing as the ground around and under them warms and softens. Also, the hard permafrost that originally prevented beaches from <strong><u>eroding </u></strong>during violent storms is now melting. People who live along Alaska’s coasts are being forced to relocate. For villages on small low islands, one terrible storm could wipe out the entire community.<br>The melting permafrost and increasing temperatures are both affecting the forests of Alaska. As the permafrost under the forests melts, insects that normally do not turn up until the warmer seasons are appearing sooner. The spruce-bark beetle, for example, is increasing in numbers as a result of warmer winter temperatures. It usually takes about two years for these beetles to grow and reproduce in very cold weather. However, due to the increase in temperatures, spruce-bark beetles are reproducing faster and damaging as many trees in one year as <strong><u>they</u></strong> previously damaged in two. If something cannot be done to changte things, Alaska’s forests will not survive the turn of the century.<br>Some scientists believe that human activity is linked to a global increase in weather temperature. Whatever the cause of rising temperatures may be, the fact remains that temperatures are warming, affecting Alaska for the worse. Horribly, this could be a preview of what will happen to the rest of the world in the next century.<br>(Adapted from <i><strong>Reading Challenge</strong></i> by Casey Malarcher and Andrea Janzen)",
