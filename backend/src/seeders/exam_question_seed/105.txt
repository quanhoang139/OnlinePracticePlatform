In his eagerness to draw quick profit from the trees, he has cut them down in large numbers, only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had.<br>Two thousand years ago a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire. It gained the empire but, without its trees, its soil became hard and poor. When the empire fell to pieces, the country found itself faced by floods and starvation.<br>Even though a government realizes the importance of a plentiful supply of trees, it is difficult for it to persuade the villager to see this. The villager wants wood to cook his food with, and he can earn money by making charcoal or selling wood to the townsman. He is usually too lazy or too careless to plant and look after trees. So unless the government has a good system of control, or can educate the people, the forests will slowly disappear.<br>This does not only mean that there will be fewer trees. The results are even more serious. For where there are trees their roots break the soil up, allowing the rain to sink in and also <strong><u>bind</u></strong> the soil, thus preventing it<br>being washed away easily, but where there are no trees, the soil becomes hard and poor. The rain falls on hard ground and flows away on the surface, causing floods and carrying away with it the rich topsoil, in which crops grow so well. When all the topsoil is gone, nothing remains but a worthless desert.",

Thanks to some clever and concerned architects, this image is starting to change. The concept of green cities aims to bring some beauty from rural environments into urban areas. It is not only about looking better though. Green cities are also trying to improve the efficiency of cities and raise the standard of living for people who stay in them.<br>The term “green cities” refers to cities where builders take into account several environmental factors before those cities are constructed or redesigned. For starters, green cities are designed to be more physically<br>appealing than traditional cities from the past. In addition, the <strong><u>mobility</u></strong> of citizens should be considered, so public transportation can be more convenient and travel time to work can be reduced. Energy sources should also be evaluated with the goal of minimizing air pollution.<br>When it comes to going green, the city of Barcelona is far ahead of its time. Since 1859, its designers have consciously tried to create sustainable urban designs. Then in 1992, the city received a well-deserved before hosting the Olympic Games. In recent years, Barcelona has upgraded its transportation system. This has reduced air pollution and more workers are using public transportation instead of their own vehicles. Barcelona also boasts one of the best recycling programs in the world. Visitors will find clear, color-coded trash bins throughout the city where <strong><u>they</u></strong> can put all of their materials.",
