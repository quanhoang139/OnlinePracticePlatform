In many American universities the total work for a degree consists of thirty-six courses each lasting for one semester. A typical course consists of three classes per week for fifteen weeks; while attending a university a student will probably attend four or five courses during each semester. Normally a student would expect to take four years attending two semesters each year. It is possible to spread the period of work for the degree over a longer period. It is also possible for a student to move between one university and another during his degree course, though <strong>this</strong> is not in fact done as a regular practice.<br>   For every course that he follows a student is given a grade, which is recorded, and the record is<br>available for the student to show to prospective employers. All this imposes a constant pressure and strain of work, but in spite of this some students still find time for great activity in student affairs. Elections to positions in student organizations arouse much enthusiasm. The effective work of maintaining discipline is usually performed by students who advise the academic authorities. Any student who is thought to have broken the rules, for example, by cheating has to appear before a student court. With the enormous numbers of students, the operation of the system does involve a certain amount of activity. A student who has held one of these positions of authority is much respected and it will be of benefit to him later in his career.<br>                                                                                              (Adapted from education.nsw.gov.au)",

It was built over 2,000 years ago and stretches for about 13,000 miles across northern China. The wall was constructed to protect the Chinese Empire from invasions by enemy forces, and it has great historical and cultural significance. However, the Great Wall is now facing various threats that could damage or destroy this important heritage site. One major problem is erosion. Over the centuries, wind, rain, and snow have caused significant damage to the wall, especially in certain sections. In addition, human activities such as tourism and construction projects have also contributed to the deterioration of the wall. To <strong><u>address</u></strong> these issues, several preservation efforts are being undertaken. First, experts are working on developing new techniques to prevent further<br>erosion of the wall. For example, they are experimenting with different types of coatings and materials to protect the wall's surface from weathering. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to restore damaged sections of the wall using traditional methods and materials.<br>   Another challenge is managing the increasing number of visitors to the Great Wall. Tourism is an important source of revenue for the local communities, but it can also cause damage to the fragile structure of the wall. To mitigate these effects, authorities have implemented measures such as limiting the number of visitors allowed in certain areas and building elevated walkways to reduce foot traffic on the wall itself. <strong><u>They</u></strong> are also promoting sustainable tourism practices and raising awareness about the importance of preserving the wall among tourists.<br>   Lastly, education plays a crucial role in preserving the Great Wall. Local communities, schools, and organizations are working together to educate people about the history and significance of the wall. By fostering a sense of pride and ownership among the public, it is hoped that more people will be motivated to protect this iconic symbol of Chinese culture and history. Preserving the Great Wall of China is a challenging task that requires the cooperation and support of various stakeholders. With continued efforts, it is possible to safeguard this important heritage site for future generations to appreciate and admire.<br>(Adapted from https://savingplaces.org)",
