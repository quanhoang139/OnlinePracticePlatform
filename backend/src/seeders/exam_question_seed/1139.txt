Will you be able to access your own money easily enough or will you need to take cash with you? Think about eating huger lunches and smaller evening meals to help your money go further, as lunch is generally cheaper. Make sure that you keep sufficient identification with you at all times. It may also help to email a copy of your passport details to yourself, in case it is lost or stolen. Label your suitcases clearly so that <strong><u>they</u></strong> can be easily identified as yours. It can be useful to store a copy of your itinerary in a <strong><u>prominent</u></strong> place in your suitcase so that the airline will know where to find you if your luggage gets lost.
