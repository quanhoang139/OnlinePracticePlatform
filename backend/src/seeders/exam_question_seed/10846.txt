The rapid destruction of the tropical rain forests, which are the ecosystems with the highest known  species diversity on Earth, has awakened people to the importance and fragility of biological diversity. The high  rate of species extinctions in these environments is jolting, but it is important to recognize the significance of  biological diversity in all ecosystems. As the human population continues to expand, <i><strong><u>it </u></strong></i>will negatively affect  one after another of Earth’s ecosystems. In terrestrial ecosystems and in fringe marine ecosystems (such as  wetlands), the most common problem is habitat destruction. In most situations, the result is irreversible. Now  humans are beginning to destroy marine ecosystems through other types of activities, such as disposal and runoff  of poisonous waste; in less than two centuries, by significantly reducing the variety of species on Earth, they  have irrevocably redirected the course of evolution.<br>However, nothing has ever equaled the magnitude and speed with which the human species is altering  the physical and chemical world and demolishing the environment. In fact, there is wide agreement that it is the  rate of change humans are inflicting, even more than the changes themselves, that will lead to biological  devastation. Life on Earth has continually been <i><strong><u>in flux </u></strong></i>as slow physical and chemical changes have occurred  on Earth, but life needs time to adapt-time for migration and genetic adaptation within existing species and time  for the proliferation of new genetic material and new species that may be able to survive in new environments.",
