After seven weeks of volunteering, participants have two weeks to travel independently before returning to London to evaluate the program and get their flight back to the United States.<br>Deciding to participate takes a small leap of faith. The roster of volunteer placements and housing options can change from year to year and volunteers can't choose their placement in advance. But once you're accepted you instantly feel that you've joined a close-knit group. The volunteer coordinator is in frequent contact through mailings and e-mails to help you prepare for the trip, and there is a daylong orientation in New York that bring all the volunteers together before departure for London.",
