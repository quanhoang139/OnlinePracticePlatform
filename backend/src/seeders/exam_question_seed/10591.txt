With Maglev technology, their dreams are now a reality. Maglev trains have no wheels. Instead, <strong><u>powerful</u> </strong>magnets lift them into the air and push them forward, at speeds of up to 500 km per hour.<br>As well as speed, Maglev has a number of advantages over other transport systems. The trains are quieter and the journey is smoother because <strong><u>they</u> </strong>don’t have wheels. They are also greener because they don’t use fuel and so create less pollution. Right now there is only one high-speed Maglev train system in the world. It carries passengers from Shanghai city centre to the airport. However, work has started on a new, longer Maglev track in Japan. Trains will go from Tokyo to Nagoya in 40 minutes. But don’t expect to ride on it on your next trip to Japan. It won’t open until 2027! Then, in 2045, the line will extend to Osaka.<br>There is one major problem with Maglev technology: it is incredibly expensive to build the tracks. Transport planners predict that the Tokyo to Osaka line will cost 91 billion dollars. The high cost means that Maglev technology probably won’t replace other forms of transport in the near future. However, the technology is still in development and somebody might find a cheaper and simpler way to build the tracks. And then, who knows? In the future, some of us might fly to work by train.<br>(Adapted from <i>Navigate </i>by Caroline Krantz and Julie Norton)",

In Britain they first appeared in 1953 and by the 1960s, there were already a few cameras in major streets in London. Today, there are more than four million CCTV cameras across the country. That’s one camera for every fourteen people. The cameras are there to film dangerous or illegal behaviour. With new software, <strong><u>they</u> </strong>can automatically recognize the faces of known offenders, and a new kind of CCTV in the Netherlands can detect angry voices and automatically warn the police of trouble. Some CCTV cameras can even interact with the people they are watching. But these cameras don’t just watch criminals; they watch all of us, almost all of the time.<br>The amount of surveillance in towns and cities across Britain is increasing because it is thought to <strong><u>deter</u> </strong>crime. Some goods in shops now have RFID tags (radio frequency identification tags) attached to them. When you pick up one of these items, the RFID tag sends a radio message to a CCTV camera and the camera starts filming you. Shops say that this technology helps to catch shoplifters - but only by treating everybody as a potential criminal.<br>Cameras and tags are not the only ways of <strong><u>monitoring</u> </strong>our actions. Every time you make or receive a call on your mobile phone, the phone company knows the number of the phone you are calling and how long the call lasts. It is even possible to work out your exact location. The police often use this information when they’re investigating serious crimes.<br>Even when you are at home, you are not necessarily safe from surveillance. High-speed internet connections have made computers more vulnerable than ever before. When you use your computer to visit websites, you are probably sending and receiving ‘cookies’ without realizing it. Cookies transfer information from your computer to the website and, in theory, could record which websites you visit. Modern technology is making it easier and easier to stay in contact, but it is also making it nearly impossible for us to hide.<br>(Adapted from <i>Aim High </i>by Tim Falla and Paul A Davies)",
