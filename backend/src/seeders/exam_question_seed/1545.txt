Many schools have brought television sets, intending to use them effectively to improve the quality of education; but actually they are rarely used properly in classrooms. Meanwhile, children spending the majority of their out-of-school hours watching TV and their typical school days proceed as if television did not exist.<br>There are some explanations for the failure of television to get the interest of the teachers. Firstly, the schools that purchased television sets have not set aside money for equipment repairs and maintenance so these television sets are sooner and later out of work. Secondly these schools have not found an effective way to train teachers to integrate television into their ongoing instructional programs. Lastly, most teachers do not regard the quality of television and its usefulness in the classroom.<br>Teachers at the schools work hard for at least twelve years to train their students to become good readers. However, according a recent statistic, teenagers seldom spend their free time reading books and newspapers but watching television instead.",
