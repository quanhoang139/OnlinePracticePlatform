To address this issue, we must implement stricter laws and fines to deter littering. Additionally, increasing the number of trash bins in public areas can make it easier for people to dispose of waste properly. Education plays a vital role, too; schools and community programs should teach the importance of keeping our surroundings clean. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the negative impacts of littering and encourage responsible behavior. By taking these steps, we can create a cleaner, healthier environment for everyone.",
