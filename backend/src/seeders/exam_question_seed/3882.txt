It can also be very expensive. Some organic food costs twice as much as non-organic food. Parents of young children, and even some pet owners, will pay high prices for organic food if they think it's healthier.<br>There is one main difference between organic and non-organic food. Organic farms do not use agricultural chemicals such as pesticides that stop insects from damaging crops. Some people think organic also means \"locally grown\", and originally this was true. But over time organic farming has become big business, with many organic foods now being grown by large agricultural companies that sell their products far from where they're grown. Processed food made with organic ingredients has also become more popular.<br>So, is organic food safer and more nutritious? Many farmers and consumers believe it is. <strong><u>They</u></strong> think agricultural chemicals can cause serious illnesses like cancer. Also, recent studies have shown that eating organically-grown produce reduces your chances of developing heart disease. However, many doctors also believe we should reduce the amount of sugar in our diets. They recommend carefully checking the list of ingredients on processed food and drinks for all the words that really mean sugar, like glucose, sucrose and fructose. This means processed foods that are called \"organic\" can also be very unhealthy if they contain lots of sugar.<br>Whether organic food is healthier or not is still not clear, so more research is needed. However, consumers of organic food often say \"better safe than sorry\" when it comes to what we eat.",
