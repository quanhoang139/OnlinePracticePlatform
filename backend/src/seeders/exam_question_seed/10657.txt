His family was originally from France. He was a doctor who made great contributions to medicine as well as the people in Viet Nam. In 1890, Yersin left Europe to work as a medical doctor on a ship near Indochina, where he explored the region. In 1894, he was sent to Hong Kong to deal with an infectious disease. Then, he discovered a bacterium responsible for the disease and saved millions of people's lives.<br>One year later, Yersin established a small laboratory in Nha Trang to prepare serums against the disease in human beings and cattle. To <strong>fund</strong> the laboratory, he started to grow corn, rice, and coffee, and introduced the rubber tree in Indochina. <strong>It</strong> later became a branch of the Pasteur Institute in Paris.<br>From 1902 to 1904, he lived in Ha Noi and helped establish Ha No Medical University. He was also the first medical director of the university. In 1920, he introduced the first effective drug for preventing and treating malaria in the region.<br>His house in Nha Trang is now the Yersin Museum. A university in Da Lat was named Yersin University in his honour.",

Having a job while at school can benefit secondary school students in several ways.<br><strong>A.</strong> Developing students' skills for future jobs<br>To begin with, students can gain and develop important skills that may be useful in their future careers. The real work environment can help students learn more new skills as well as improve existing ones such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving skills. For example, if a student works as a waiter or waitress, he or she can learn how to greet and communicate with customers. Those who are <strong><u>equipped</u></strong> with various life skills can perform better in their future jobs.<br><strong>B.</strong> Boosting students' confidence<br>In addition, having a part-time job can provide students with more experience and then boost their confidence. Students will become more confident if <strong><u>they</u></strong> have opportunities to work together with different groups of people. As we may know, a teaching assistant will help the teacher prepare and present the lesson or mark students assignments. Students who apply for the post of <strong><u>a teaching assistant</u></strong> are required to meet and interact with the teachers, students of different ages, or even parents. This can develop their classroom experience as well as confidence.<br><strong>C.</strong> Building their professional network for future<br>Finally, those who have a part-time job can build more relationship for their careers in the future.
