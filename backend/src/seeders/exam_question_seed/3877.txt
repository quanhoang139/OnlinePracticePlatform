Young people are usually more willing to talk if they believe that questions are asked out of real interest and not because people are trying to check up on them.<br>Parents should do their best to talk to their sons and daughters about school work and future plans but should not push them to talk if they don't want to. Parents should also watch for the danger signs: some young people in trying to be adults may experiment with sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking.
