When you look at a photo of identical twins, you might see that they both have the same height, hair and eye color.<br>When you first see them, identical twins look the same, but there are some differences in their looks. Patrick Flynn, a computer scientist from the University of Notre Dame in the United States, uses computer technology to look closely at identical twins. Computers can recognize people when <i><strong>they</strong></i> cut their hair or grow a beard. So how about twins? Can computers tell the difference? The answer is: Yes! While humans can tell how people feel, computers are good at noticing very small physical differences. Technology can see things like differences in the size of freckles.<br>So what can humans do to identify identical twins? Their personalities can be different. One twin may be <i>quiet,</i> while the other twin may be <i>talkative.</i> They may also like different things and have different hobbies. Looking alike doesn’t mean acting alike.",
