In the old times, pollution came from nature, such as floods, forest fires and vocanoes. For the past 200 years, humans have been the major cause of pollution. We have polluted the air with our cars, waste from our homes, and toxic substances from factories. We have harmed the land by cutting down trees in the forest to build roads and new houses without careful planning and thinking. We have polluted the soil with chemicals and rubbish. We have polluted the water by dumping rubbish and chemicals in the rivers and oceans. Besides, we have caused oil spills which damaged the beaches and harmed marine animals and birds that lives nearby. The only way to save our environment is that we must stop or limit pollution. Conservation is one of the best ways to protect our environment. Conservation includes the suitable use of natural resources and the protection of our environment. To illustrate, we use water and control water pollution by not producing too much waste. Besides, recycling and reusing things many times or in a new way are strongly encouraged. Recycling can help us conserve our natural resources and avoid throwing away rubbish. Moreover, it is very important that we have proper disposal of sewage and rubbish so that they cannot pollute the environment.",
