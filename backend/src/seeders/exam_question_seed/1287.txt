First, it is a non-polluting and abundant source of energy. It does not pollute the air by releasing harmful gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide or sulphur oxide. So, the risk of damage to the environment is reduced. More importantly, solar energy can be used to produce electricity as long as the sun exists and of course sunlight is available everywhere. In addition, to generate electricity from solar power, people only need some solar panels, which are easy to be installed. And finally, this energy from the sun can be used in remote locations, where running power lines are difficult or costly. Solar panels can be set up as long as they receive the sunlight.<br>Write full answers to the questions with information from the passage.",
