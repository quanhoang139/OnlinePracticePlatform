These can be mammals such as squirrels, reptiles like the sand lizard, fish, insects, and tiny little animals that you can't see easily.<br>In the UK alone, there are about 37,000 different species of animals and 65,000 different species of plants.

The main reason <strong>(6) ________</strong> some types of plants and animals are becoming endangered species is that their habitats are lost or have changed. Animals like moths, birds and bats have lost their homes as people have cut down the hedgerows they live in. Also, a lot of ponds are no longer suitable for the animals and plants to live in because they are polluted, or people have filled them in.<br>We need to save many species of endangered British wildlife from extinction before it is too late. You can help by supporting environmental groups like the Environment Agency that are working to protect our <strong>(7) _______</strong> wildlife and habitats from the danger of disappearing forever. You can even create a small wildlife habitat yourself by making a pond at school or in your garden.<br><i>(Adapted from Upstream Level B1+ by Virginia Evans and Lynda Edwards)</i>",

Yet Chris Moon, 39, is refreshingly <strong>down to earth</strong>, even to the point of finding it difficult to keep the initial appointments for this interview, proving that even superheroes can’t be in two places at once.<br>At present, Chris runs a company called Making the Best (MTB) to help clients solve problems in human resources and security management. You don’t need to speak to him for long before you realise that this is a particularly appropriate title. Not only does he talk with an almost <strong>evangelical</strong> zeal about his desire to empower others to get the best out of themselves and their business, but his own philosophy is all about making the best of any situation, however grim <strong>it</strong> may seem.<br>“I decided it was about doing the best we can, reaching our full potential and making use of our talents. It’s also about involvement with other people. I wanted to make a difference, do something I could be trained in but also grow as a person, so I decided to join the army.” On graduating from Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Royal Military Police and also served with several infantry units.<br>After leaving the army, he felt he wanted to do some sort of charity work, and when he heard that the British charity, the HALO Trust - which specialises in mine clearance - wanted an army officer with agricultural and command experience, he was keen to get involved. It was while clearing mines in Cambodia that he was abducted by the Khmer Rouge, an experience which, not surprisingly, had a profound effect on him. “When we were first kidnapped, I thought I had no control as I kept thinking I can’t do anything about this. But my one thought was never to assume the role of victim. It would have been so easy to give up, but I quickly realised that fear is a state of inactivity. You have to be positive and pursue logic and reason. That was, and still is, my driving force.”<br>The things he learned from this experience helped him to survive when he was blown up by a mine two years later, while walking in a supposedly clear area in Mozambique. He lost his lower right arm and leg, but does not consider himself a victim. He accepts responsibility because he chose to work in mined areas. So, after all the experiences he has been through, is he surprised to find himself running his own business? “My mum’s cousin had an extremely successful dairy business and when I was very young, he said to me: ‘When you’ve done all the other things you want to do, set up a business and help the best out of people.’ He obviously had it right.”<br>(Adapted from Upstream Advanced by Virginia Evans and Lynda Edwards)",

On July 20, 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the Moon. Now that humans have been to the Moon and robots have been sent to Mars, some people believe the next step is for humans to visit Mars. There's no doubt that the first person to walk on Mars will become as famous as Gagarin or Armstrong, and many astronauts would love the opportunity. But what is space travel really like for the men and women who go on these missions?<br>Many astronauts suffer physical problems on these missions, even if they are in space for just a few months. Some of these problems are short-lived; others may be long-lasting. More than two-thirds of all astronauts suffer from motion sickness while traveling in space. In an environment without gravity, the body cannot tell up from down. The body's internal balance system sends confusing signals to the brain, which can result in nausea lasting as long as a few days. The amount of blood and other fluids in the body also ends up being <strong>distributed</strong> differently after an extended period of time in this environment. More fluid than normal ends up in the face, neck, and chest, resulting in a puffy face, bulging neck veins, and a slightly enlarged heart.<br>In addition to physical difficulties, astronauts who travel for long periods may also suffer from psychological stress. Space travel requires astronauts to be very focused, balanced people. The irregular sleep, long working hours, and the lack of night and day can affect a person's emotions and stress level.<br>Being able to control one's emotions is an important characteristic for an astronaut. A major factor that affects astronauts' mental well-being is time. To date, astronauts have only spent a few months in space at a time, but longer expeditions would require astronauts to spend significantly more time inside a spaceship. Being confined in a small space for such a long period of time is not healthy.<br>Astronauts- especially those who achieved significant “firsts” such as Gagarin and Armstrong-are often seen as exciting adventurers. This may be accurate, but it's also worth remembering their dedication and the sacrifices <strong>they</strong> make to explore our universe.<br>(Adapted from Active Skills for Reading by Neil J Anderson)",
