However, there are a lot of annoying things in big cities. The most  common problems are air pollution and noise.<br>Traffic is the main cause of air pollution and noise. For example, drivers in New York are famous for honking their horns and shouting. That noise drives many visitors crazy - it even drives a lot of the locals crazy, too. Other big cities have similar problems with their traffic.<br>City governments have a lot of pressure to solve these problems. The most common solution is public transportation. Public transportation is a form of travel provided by the government. For example, New York's biggest form of public transportation is the subway.<br>Public transportation helps reduce these problems, but it is not enough. Another solution is bicycle sharing. This is a system that provides cheap bicycles. In cities that have bicycle sharing programmes, there are spots that have parked public bikes. People borrow the bikes and use them. They can <strong><u>drop off</u></strong> the bike at the same spot where they borrowed it, or they can drop it off at another spot.<br>Bicycle sharing programmes are different in each city. In some cities, the bikes are completely free. They are not even locked. In other cities, you have to pay a small deposit. You get the deposit back when you return the bike. In still other cities, you need to have a membership with the bicycle sharing programme. Once you have a membership with the bicycle sharing programme, you can use a bike at any time you want.<br>Bicycle sharing is hugely popular all over the world. People love this system because it is cheap, clean, and easy to use. There are bicycle sharing systems in <strong><u>dozens of</u></strong> countries and hundreds of cities. In total, there are more than 530 bicycle sharing systems around the world, and that number is going up all the time.",

They can grow to be as tall as 9 feet and can weigh as much as 250 pounds. Even though they have wings, they cannot fly. Instead, ostriches have long, powerful legs that help them to run very fast when they feel <strong><u>threatened</u></strong>. Ostriches use their wings to move themselves<br>forward and to help them change direction.<br>Ostriches are native to Africa, where they still live in desert areas and dry, open grasslands called savannahs. Ostriches can also be found in zoos all over the world. Humans have domesticated ostriches, so now ostriches live on farms in over a dozen countries, including the United States, China, India, Japan, Brazil and Costa Rica. They are raised for their meat, skin, and feathers.<br>Ostriches like to live in small groups called herds. The male ostrich is called a rooster; the female, a hen. Baby ostriches are called chicks. The female ostrich lays eggs, but both the male and the female take turns sitting on the eggs to keep <strong><u>them </u></strong>warm.",
