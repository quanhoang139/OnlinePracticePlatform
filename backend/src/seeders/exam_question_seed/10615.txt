That research base shows us how better sponsorship and improved training to counter unconscious bias can speed our progress to gender equality. And it reveals the changes that have—and haven’t—happened over the past few years.<br>There are some bright spots. In 2019, nearly 90% of respondent companies say that gender equality is a top priority. Almost half report having at least three women on their leadership team And greater openness to flexible working is allowing many more women—and men—to work remotely. But some areas are proving stubbornly difficult to improve. Most strikingly, it’s much harder for women than men to achieve their first promotion. Indeed, for every 100 men who step up from an entry level position to a management role, only 78 women—and just 52 black women—will receive the same promotion. Over five years, that gap adds up to a difference of one million promoted women, with lasting repercussions further along the talent funnel: only 1 in 5 C-suite members are women, and only 1 in 25 are women of color.<br>Moving up the ladder, the 21% figure for women in the C-suite is also less encouraging than <strong>it</strong> seems. Women are much more likely to have a staff role—chief human resources officer, general counsel, or CFO—while men take more of the <strong>line</strong> roles, running the largest business units with their own P&L lines. It’s rare for any leader in a staff role to be promoted to CEO.<br><i>(source: https://www.forbes.com/)</i>",

After graduating he moved to London where he studied surgery at Guy’s Hospital. After that the popular young doctor joined the army and over the next forty years had a brilliant career as an army medical officer, working in many far-off countries and fighting successfully for improved conditions in hospitals. It was a <i><strong>remarkable</strong></i><strong> </strong>career - made even more remarkable by the discovery upon his death that <i>he</i> was in fact a <i>she</i>, James Barry was a woman.<br>No one was more surprised at this discovery than her many friends and colleagues. It was true that throughout her life people had remarked upon her small size, slight build and smooth pale face. One officer had even <i><strong>objected</strong></i> to her appointment as a medical assistant because he could not believe that Barry was old enough to have graduated in medicine. But no one had ever seriously suggested that Barry was anything other than a man.<br>By all accounts Barry was a pleasant and good-humoured person with high cheekbones, reddish hair, a long nose and large eyes. She was well-liked by her patients and had a reputation for great speed in surgery - an important quality at a time when operations were performed without an aesthetic. She was also quick tempered. When she was working in army hospitals and prisons overseas, the terrible conditions often made her very angry. She fought hard against injustice and cruelty and her temper sometimes got her into trouble with the authority. After a long career overseas, she returned to London where she died in 1865. While the undertaker’s assistant was preparing her body for burial, she discovered that James Barry was a woman.<br>So why did James Barry deceive people for so long? At that time a woman could not study medicine, work as a doctor or join the army. Perhaps Barry had always wanted to do these things and pretending to be a man was the only way to make it possible. Perhaps she was going to tell the truth one day but didn’t because she was enjoying her life as a man too much. Whatever the reason, Barry's deception was successful. By the time it was discovered that she had been the first woman in Britain to qualify as a doctor, it was too late for the authorities to do anything about <i><strong><u>it</u></strong></i><strong>.</strong>",
