Fiction books can be found in abundance at bookstores and libraries. They can even be found on the shelves of comic shops and game shops.

These are written about facts, real people, real events and real places. Most of the time, non-fiction books are written by people who have experienced or witnessed the happenings themselves.

Two that are frequently linked to one another are earthquakes and tsunamis. Both of them can cause a great amount of devastation when they hit. However, tsunamis are the direct result of earthquakes and cannot happen without them.<br>The Earth has three main parts. They are the crust, the mantle, and the core. The crust is the outer layer of the Earth. It is not a single piece of land. Instead, it consists of a number of plates. There are a few enormous plates and many smaller ones. These plates essentially rest upon the mantle, which is fluid. As a result, the plates are in constant and slow motion. The plates may move away from or toward other plates. In some cases, they <strong><u>collide</u></strong> violently with the plates next to them. The movement of the plates causes tension in the rock. Over a long time, this tension may build up. When it is released, an earthquake happens.<br>Tens of thousands of earthquakes happen every year. The vast majority are so small that only scientific instruments can <strong><u>perceive</u></strong> them. Others are powerful enough that people can feel them, yet they cause little harm or damage. More powerful earthquakes, however, can cause buildings, bridges, and other structures to collapse. <strong><u>They</u></strong> may additionally injure and kill thousands of people and might even cause the land to change its appearance.<br>Since most of the Earth's surface is water, numerous earthquakes happen under the planet's oceans. Underwater earthquakes cause the seafloor to move. This results in the displacement of water in the ocean. When this occurs, a tsunami may form. This is a wave that forms on the surface and moves in all directions from the place where the earthquake happened. A tsunami moves extremely quickly and can travel thousands of kilometers. As it approaches land, the water near the coast gets sucked out to sea. This causes the tsunami to increase in height. Minutes later, the tsunami arrives. A large tsunami can travel far inland. As it does that, it can flood the land, destroy human settlements, and kill large numbers of people.<br>(Adapted from Perfect Toefl Junior Practice test)",
