However, very few universities can claim to be among the oldest in the world.<br>   Nalanda University, in Bihar, India, was established around 600 BC. It was most likely the world's first university. In the past, scholars came from Europe, China, and all over India to learn about science, medicine, the Buddhist religion, and other subjects. The university is in ruins now, but at one time <strong><u>it </u></strong>was an impressive school with temples, classrooms, libraries, and dormitories.<br>    According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the University of Al-Karaouine in Fes, Morocco, is the oldest surviving university in the world. It was probably <strong><u>founded</u></strong> in 859 and became a famous place to study natural sciences. The first university in Europe is definitely the University of Bologna, in Italy. It was one of the few universities in Europe that were not influenced by religion. Professors were forbidden from teaching outside the university, and so students came from all over Europe to study with its famous teachers.",

In fact, sleep plays an important role in our health. Not everyone knows it is vital to sleep in the dark. Researchers say sleeping with the light on could be bad for us. Around 40 per cent of people sleep with some sort of <strong><u>artificial</u></strong> light, from a television, alarm clock or something else. Sleeping in the dark is more difficult for people in cities, where there is a lot of outdoor light at night.<br>    Light can increase the risk of getting these diseases and some other mental problems. Turning off the light when we sleep helps to keep away diabetes and heart disease. <strong><u>One study</u></strong> Trusted Source on women found that obesity was more prevalent in those who slept with a electronic device or light on. Several studies conducted from some neighborhoods of two of the researchers have shown that the less sleep the villagers get, the more food they ’ll likely eat the next day. Sleeping with a light on interferes with sleep cycles and causes more fragmented sleep, and these downsides may be greatest in the few hours before waking up. Pitch darkness reduces potential distractions and disruptions to sleep.<br>     The researchers are from a university of medicine in Chicago, USA. Researcher Dr Phyllis Zee is an expert in sleep medicine. She said it is healthier to turn off all lights when we sleep. She conducted a study of the blood sugar levels of 20 people after nights of sleep. The people who slept with a light on had higher sugar levels than those who slept in darkness. Dr Zee said light <strong><u>stimulates</u></strong> brain activity, which raises blood sugar. She said there are three things we can do to reduce the risk of illness: turn off the lights, never sleep with white or blue light; and wear an eye mask.<br>(Adapted from breakingnewsenglish.com)",
