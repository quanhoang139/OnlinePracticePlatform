It focuses on her intense green eyes. “I knew  she had an incredible look, a <strong><u>penetrating </u></strong>gaze which can make your heart fall. She seems able to read  your mind.” Steve McCurry, the photograph taker, said in an online interview. “It was not easy to take the  picture because there was a crowd of people around us, the dust was swirling around and it was before  digital cameras and you never knew what would happen with the film.”<br>McCurry said he knew the picture was special when he developed it. “When I showed it to the editor of  the National Geographic, <strong><u>he leaped to his feet and shouted</u></strong>, ‘that’s our next cover’,” he added.<br>Just by looking at the photograph, you can feel the youth and greenness in the middle of a yellowish  desert land where fruitfulness is sparse. The black-lit image highlights the girl’s delicate features. “The  structure of the photo is fantastic, as it depicts not only the young lady who seems to brighten the  surrounding but also the perfect harmony between humankind and nature.”",

When  Ntaiya was young, her father worked in a distant city, and the family was extremely poor. As the eldest,  Ntaiya helped to feed and care for the younger children. She carried water, gathered firewood, cooked  meals, and worked in the field. Like all the girls in her village, she was supposed to follow tradition and  learn the skills to be a good Maasai wife.<br>Her father expected her to marry at age 13, as was the custom. However, Ntaiya didn’t feel the same  way. She had a plan. And she was brave enough to make <strong><u>it </u></strong>work. With all the courage she could find in  herself, she went to her father and said she would do what he wanted if he let her finish high school. Her  father agreed. Ntaiya graduated from high school with top honors.<br>After graduation, Ntaiya decided she wanted to attend college - a university in the United States. By  then, however, her father was sick and in a hospital. All the family money went to his care, so there was no  money for Ntaiya.<br>Ntaiya met the village leaders. At first, they were angry with her for daring to do what even few boys  dreamed about. She promised she would use her education to help the village. She promised to come back  and build a school. One village leader saw her <strong><u>determination </u></strong>and agreed to help her. He gave her money,  and she also received a scholarship to Randolph-Macon Women’s College in the United States. In 2004,  Ntaiya received her bachelor’s degree. Later, she got a job at the United Nations. In 2011, she received her  doctorate in education — all made possible by her courage and her will to succeed.<br>Ntaiya did not forget her promise to the village. She returned to Enoosaen and in 2009, she opened the first primary school for girls in her village, the Kakenya Center for Excellence. There the students have  education and opportunities that Ntaiya had to fight so hard for. Girls that were once forced to marry at 13  are now dreaming of becoming doctors, lawyers, pilots, and business women.",
