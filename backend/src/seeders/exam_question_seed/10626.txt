Since 2002, more than 35,000 students have joined ISV to volunteer and make a difference during their summer break. One of ISV's programs, High School Program (HSP), combining volunteer work and adventure travel, is an 18-day program for high school students aged 15-18. Since its first launch in 2007 in Australia for the first time, HSP has provided <strong><u>opportunities</u></strong> for students to make a difference to communities and those in need while learning about responsibility and global issues.<br>Each group of students is led by a seasoned ISV leader and accompanied by a High School leader (either teacher or coach) throughout their trip. HSP's regional staff are available to provide timely help. Students can live, travel and learn in a fun environment. There are a lot of activities <strong><u>that</u></strong> build good characters and inspire students to contribute their efforts and time to communities. For a couple of days, students can visit local areas and learn about their cultures or difficulties faced by local people. For the other days, they can join adventure activities to step out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves.<br>High school students can choose among three countries - Costa Rica, Dominican Republic or Thailand to spend their trip. HSP intends to expand their network to other countries. If you're a high school student, give it a shot!<br><i>(Adapted from </i><i>http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/)</i>",

There is a wide range of robots in use in industrial and manufacturing environments. <strong><u>They</u></strong> help to build cars, ships, assemble goods and much more. Robots are becoming more powerful and capable through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This creation of machines with capabilities of <strong><u>perceiving</u></strong> their environment and carrying out tasks they were programmed to perform is leading to much broader use of robotics.<br>The use of these technologies has become increasingly popular in many aspects of human lives. In the manufacturing industry, machines have helped to make work easier and faster. Today robots are being used in other areas.<br>In restaurants<strong>, </strong>robots are used in kitchens to prepare food and chop vegetables. This technology is used in Japan for making sushi and chopping vegetables. Robots also being experimented with to work as receptionists, cleaners in many restaurants and homes.
