But a doctor’s suggestion that she should become an accountant  rather than follow a hopeless musical career strengthened her will to succeed.<br>As it turned out, music was one of the most advantageous careers she could have chosen and is one  reason why her speech remains so extraordinarily correct, despite her deafness. Occasionally she listens to  recordings by holding a cassette player between her knees, interpreting the vibrations and the shaking  movements. Her deafness is one of the reasons for her <strong><u>unique </u></strong>style, for she cannot listen and be influenced  by other performances and she has often declared that getting her hearing back would be the worst thing that  could happen to her.<br>As a result of her devotion to her music and her determination to succeed, she has doubled the range  of works available for percussion music in Europe and introduced instruments previously unheard of in the  west. She has also asked composers to write more than fifty new pieces of music for these instruments, and  has set up a library of three hundred works for other musicians to use.<br>(Adapted from <i>Richmond FCE Practice Tests</i>",

Without formal training, any  individual has the <strong><u>faculty </u></strong>for recognising music and, in some fashion, making it. Why this should be so is a  mystery. After all, music is not necessary for getting through the day, and if it aids in reproduction, it does so  only in highly indirect ways. Language, by contrast, is also everywhere - but for reasons that are more  obvious.<br>Scientists have always been intrigued by the connection between music and language. Yet over the  years, words and melody have acquired a vastly different status in the lab and the seminar room. While  language has long been considered essential to unlocking the mechanisms of human intelligence, music is  generally treated as an evolutionary frippery - mere \"auditory cheesecake\", as the Harvard cognitive scientist  Steven Pinker puts it.<br>But thanks to a decade-long wave of neuroscience research, that tune is changing. Human musical  preferences are fundamentally shaped by the messy sounds of real life, and of speech in particular – <strong><u>which </u></strong>in  turn is shaped by our evolutionary heritage. The explanation of music, like the explanation of any product of  the mind, must be rooted in biology. Far from being abstract, music presents a strange analogue to the  patterns created by the sounds of speech. Music, like visual arts, is rooted in our experience of the natural  world. It emulates our sound environment in the way that visual arts <strong><u>emulate </u></strong>the visual environment.<br>This brings up some chicken-or-egg evolutionary questions. It may be that music imitates speech  directly, the researchers say, in which case it would seem that language evolved first. It is also conceivable  that music came first and language is in effect an imitation of song - that in everyday speech we hit the  musical notes we especially like. Alternately, it may be that music imitates the general products of the human  sound-making system, which just happens to be mostly speech. We cannot know this, but what we do know  is that they both come from the same system, and it is this that shapes our preferences.<br>(Adapted from <i>IELTS Practice Tests</i>)",
