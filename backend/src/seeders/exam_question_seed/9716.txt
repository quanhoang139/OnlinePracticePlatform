Do you really think it would be awesome to have every move questioned? Everyone telling you they know how to live your life better than you. This would seem like as prison to me. I remember Michael Jordan said.

If going after wealth causes you to treat people bad just for a dollar then you'll have no one to enjoy that wealth with.

Just don't let them fool you that with fame and wealth you have no problems.",
