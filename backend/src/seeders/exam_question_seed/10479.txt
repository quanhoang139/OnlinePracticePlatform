Within 10 years the number of people aged over 60 will pass one billion, a report by the UN Population Fund said. The demographic shift will present huge challenges to countries' welfare, pension and healthcare systems. The UN agency also said more had to be done to tackle <strong><u>abuse</u></strong>, neglect and violence against older persons\".<br>The number of older people worldwide is growing faster than any other age group. The report, Ageing in the 21st Century: A Celebration and a Challenge, estimates that one in nine people around the world is older than 60. The elderly population is expected to swell by 200 million in the next decade to surpass one billion, and reach two billion by 2050. This rising proportion of older people is a consequence of success - improved nutrition, sanitation, healthcare, education and economic well-being are contributing factors, the report says.<br>But the UN and a charity that also contributed to the report, Help Age International, say the aging population is being widely mismanaged. \"In many developing countries with large populations of young people, the challenge is that governments have not put policies and practices in place to support <strong><u>their</u></strong> current older populations or made enough preparations for 2050,\" the agencies said in a joint statement.<br><i>(Source: www.ieltsbuddy.com)</i>",

Parents worry about which sites their children spend time on, who they chat to online and the possible effects that computer games might have on <strong><u>them</u></strong>. For teachers, meanwhile, the main worry is the way the Internet makes cheating easier!<br>Schools and universities say there has been a huge increase in plagiarism – taking other people’s words and ideas and pretending that they are your own. In the past, anyone who wanted to copy had to go to a library, find the right books, read through them, find the sections they needed and then physically write down the words they wanted to use. Nowadays, though, students can simply copy extracts from websites- while really desperate students sometimes copy whole essays! As if this wasn’t bad enough, sites offering to actually do homework – at a price – have also started appearing.<br>Despite all this, we shouldn’t assume that the Internet only brings problems. Indeed, you could say that for every problem the Internet creates, it also brings a solution. Parents can now use sophisticated controls to stop kids accessing sites that might do them harm, while new software helps teachers to <strong><u>detect</u></strong> copied work immediately. Many, of course, are already able to recognize when someone is cheating! “Some students suddenly start using words they can’t possibly understand like dialectical antagonism”, explains one teacher, “or parts of their essays feel different.”<br>One of the hardest things for teachers today is deciding how to mix modern technology with traditional study skills – and how best to use the Web in class. As more and more schools <strong><u>install</u></strong> computers in every classroom, the role of the teacher is changing. Making sure students don’t just copy things and do learn how to quote copied work properly is part of their job, but so is designing suitable projects to fully exploit the Web in helping students learn about subjects and develop their life and social skills.<br><i>                         (Adapted from Pre-Intermediate Outcomes by Hugh Della $ Andrew Walkley)</i>",
