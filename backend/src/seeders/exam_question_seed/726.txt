It is even predicted that they will be the future of city  architecture. This is because lack of space and <strong><u>overpriced</u> </strong>land in cities makes it difficult to  increase the number of parks and other green areas. So, what makes these ‘green roofs’ so attractive to city dwellers?<br>Roof gardens can improve air quality in cities. Plants take in and keep heat and light, and help to cool the environment around them. This way, green roofs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions  related to heating and cooling buildings. They also help decrease dust pollution and the formation of  smog, a mixture of smoke and fog, which is common in big cities.<br>Moreover, green roofs can provide new habitats for wildlife. They can help reduce the impact of  urban development on habitat loss. For example, the City Hall in Chicago, the USA, has become  home to more than 20,000 plants of over 150 different kinds. The living roof of Vancouver  Convention Centre in Canada hosts 400,000 plants and 60,000 bees. Roof gardens also attract birds  and insects, which increases the biodiversity in the area.<br>In summary, roof gardens can reduce pollution and improve human interaction with nature by  introducing green space into the built environment. Connecting with nature is beneficial to our  physical and mental health, and can increase quality of life.",
