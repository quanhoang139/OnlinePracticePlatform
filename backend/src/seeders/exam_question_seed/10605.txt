They didn’t like a new requirement that made them take part in the school’s community service program.<br>Future seniors, however, probably won't be as resistant now that the program has been broken in. Some, like John Maloney, already have completed their required hours of approved community service. The Bowie High School sophomore earned his hours in eighth grade by volunteering two nights a week at the Larkin-Chase Nursing and Restorative Center in Bowie. He played shuffleboard, cards, and other games with the senior citizens. He also helped plan parties for them and visited their rooms to keep them company. That experience inspired him to continue volunteering in the community.<br>John, 15, is not finished volunteering. Once a week he videotapes animals at the Prince George County animal shelter in Forestville. His <strong>footage</strong> is shown on the Bowie public access television channel in hopes of finding homes for the animals. \"Volunteering is better than just sitting  around,\" says John, \"and I like animals; I don't want to see them put to sleep. \"<br>He's not the only volunteer in his family. His sister, Melissa, an eighth grader, has completed her hours also volunteering at Larkin-Chase. \"It is a good idea to have kids go out into the community, but it's frustrating to have to write essays about the work,\" she said. \"<strong>It</strong> makes you feel like you're doing it for the requirement and not for yourself.\" The high school's service learning office, run by Beth Ansley, provides information on organizations seeking volunteers so that students will have an easier time fulfilling their hours. \"It's ridiculous that people are opposing the requirements,\" said Amy Rouse, who this summer has worked at the Ronald McDonald House and has helped to rebuild a church in Clinton. \"So many people won't do the service unless it's mandatory,\" Rouse said, \"but once they start doing it, they'll really like it and hopefully it will become a part of their lives - like it has become a part of mine.\"",

Scientists are studying genes that could mean long life for us all.<br>There are already many, many people who have passed the landmark age of 100. In fact, there are now so many healthy, elderly people that there’s a name for them: the wellderly. These are people over the age of eighty who have no major illnesses, such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes.<br>There are many scientific studies of communities where healthy old age is typical. These include places like Calabria in southern Italy and the island of Okinawa in Japan. In Calabria, the small village of Molochio has about 2,000 inhabitants. And of these, there are at least eight people over a hundred years old. When researchers ask people like this the secret of their long life, the answer is almost always about food and is almost always the same: ‘I eat a lot of fruit and vegetables.’ ‘I eat a little bit of everything.’ ‘I neither smoke nor drink.’<br>In the past, scientists looked at things such as diet and lifestyle for an explanation of long life, these days <strong><u>they</u></strong> are also looking at genetics. Researcher Eric Topol says that there must be genes that explain why people are protected from the effects of aging process. The new research into long life did <strong><u>scrutinize</u></strong> groups of people who have a genetic connection. One interesting group lives in Ecuador. In one area of the country there are a number of people with the same genetic condition. It’s called Laron syndrome. These people don’t grow very tall – just over one metre. But Laron syndrome also give them protection against cancer and diabetes. As a result, they live longer than other people in their families. Meanwhile, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, there’s another group of long-lived men, Japanese-Americans. They have a similar gene to the Laron syndrome group.<br>Back in Calabria, researchers constructed the family trees of the 100-year-old people. They looked at family information from the 19th century to today. It is concluded that there are genetic factors that give health benefits to the men. This is a surprising result because generally in Europe, women live longer than men. So what really makes people live longer? It seems likely that it is an interaction of genes, the environment and probably a third factor – luck.",
