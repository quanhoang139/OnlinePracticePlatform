Talking to real native speakers is the best way to improve your English skills, speaking at least.<br><strong>Slow down:</strong> If you want to be understood, slow down. The more clearly you speak, the better chance your listener has of understanding you.<br><strong>Record yourself:</strong> We really don't know our pronunciation. So record yourself!
