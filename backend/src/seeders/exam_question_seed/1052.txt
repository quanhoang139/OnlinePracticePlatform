It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.<br>The vaccine has already been reviewed by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), <strong><u>which</u></strong> makes recommendations for vaccines’ use in populations (i.e. recommended age groups, intervals between shots, advice for specific groups such as pregnant and lactating women). The SAGE recommended the vaccine for all age groups 18 and above in its interim recommendations dated 25 January 2021.<br>The US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Moderna vaccine on 18 December 2020 and a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union was granted by the European Medicines Agency on 6 January 2021. The WHO’s EUL process can be carried out quickly when vaccine developers submit the full data required by WHO in a timely manner. Once those data are submitted, WHO can rapidly assemble its evaluation team and regulators from around the world to assess the information and, when necessary, carry out inspections of manufacturing sites.<br>The Moderna vaccine is an mNRA-based vaccine. It was found by the SAGE to have an efficacy of 94.1%, based on a median follow-up of two months. Although the vaccine is provided as a frozen suspension at -25 oC to -15 oC in a multidose vial, vials can be stored refrigerated at 2-8 °C for up to 30 days prior to withdrawal of the first dose, meaning that ultra-cold chain equipment may not always be necessary to deploy the vaccine.",

In most of the world, most people are ignorant of which blood type they possess, since it is important only if they have to undergo an operation which requires a blood transfusion. In Japan, however, things are different, since a large proportion of the population believes that blood type determines personality and, as a result, over 90% of the population are aware which type they are.<br>This linking of blood type and personality has ramifications across life, but is especially prominent in prospective relationships and employment. For example, in Japan one popular way to meet romantic partners is to go to specialised venues which conduct speed dating. A single man and woman sit alone together at a table for just a few minutes. Then a bell rings, and <strong><u>they</u></strong> go to sit with someone new. Some such venues hold dating sessions which are limited to men or women of a particular blood type. For those who believe in the blood-type theory, this seems to maximise their chance of finding someone special.<br>The current popularity of the idea exploded in the 1970s following the publication of a book by Masahiko Nomi, even though he was a lawyer and broadcaster who had no medical or psychological training. His ideas were largely anecdotal, and many critics thought it mere superstition, but the book nevertheless <strong><u>sparked</u></strong> great interest in the general public. Now his son, Toshitaka, continues to promote the theory, and nowadays it is ubiquitous in Japanese popular culture, featuring on morning TV, women’s magazines and best-selling self-help books.<br>Much like horoscopes in the West, the blood group theory is regularly <strong><u>debunked</u></strong> by scientific experimentation, yet it retains popular appeal. Perhaps one reason for this is that it helps to break the ice in social situations. Japanese people do not always find it easy to express their opinions, so discussing blood types is an indirect way of telling people what you think of them.",
