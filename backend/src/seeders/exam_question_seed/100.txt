In order to keep up with the market, online stores have started to gravitate towards new trends.<br>One way in which mobile devices are being utilized for shopping is through social media. Facebook and Instagram have opened up the ecommerce marketplace and made it easier for users to shop through their social media platforms. Instagram, for example, has started to offer a feature for direct product links to be tagged in posts that even include product and price details.<br>Additionally, companies have taken to social media to advertise their brands and products. At this point, a company without a Facebook or Instagram account is, quite frankly, a step behind. People spend hours scrolling through their social media news feeds daily. Even if a company isn’t directly paying for advertisements, their own accounts serve as an effective self promotion tool.<br>(Sounce: https://www.entrepreneur.com)",

But corals are made up of hundreds of thousands of small organisms which live and feed like any other sea life. For the past five years, researchers in Hawaii and Australia have been engineering corals inside a lab to see if they could better <strong><u>resist</u></strong> the effects of climate change. They say it is now time to see how their creations perform in nature. The scientists say climate change linked to human causes has led to warming oceans that can harm sea life. <strong><u>They</u></strong> say if the more heat-resistant corals they developed do well in the ocean, the method can be used to help save suffering and dying reefs.<br>The team tested three methods for making corals that would be strong and healthy in nature. One was the method of selective breeding. This method involves scientists choosing parents with desirable characteristics for reproductive purposes. A second method subjected the corals to increasing temperatures to condition them to be able to survive in warm ocean environments. The third involved making changes to the algae that provide corals with necessary nutrients. The leader of the project, University of Hawaii researcher Kira Hughes, said all the methods proved successful in the lab. She told The Associated Press that some scientists might worry that such methods go against the natural processes of nature. But with the planet continuing to warm more and more, she does not see any better options.<br>“We have to intervene in order to make a change for coral reefs to survive into the future,” Hughes said. When ocean temperatures rise, corals release algae that supplies nutrients and gives them color. This causes them to turn white, a process called <strong><u>bleaching</u></strong>. When this happens, corals can quickly become sick and die. But for years, scientists have been observing corals that have survived bleaching, even when others have died on the same reef. They are now centering on those healthy survivors and hoping to further increase their resistance to heat. Those corals were used as the parents for the newly created kinds.<br>(https://learningenglish.voanews.com)",
