        "group_content": "Over the last several decades, environmental specialists have proposed various strategies aimed at slowing down this process of deforestation in developing countries. Many of these proposals are indeed valuable ideas in that they are realistic attempts to address some of the causes of deforestation, such as farming, battle ranching, and commercial logging. All of <strong>them </strong>rely on government involvement of some kind. <br>There are three broad categories of solutions: state economic policies, internal agreements, and  international programs. Economic policies generally attempt to limit the activity of small farmers through government action. Government actions can include the clear proper definition and enforcement of property rights, meaning that squatting, or illegally setting on land, would be more difficult. Subsidies can be used to encourage conservation. That is, money may be paid to supplement the income of those farmers who make an effort to reduce the usual amount of damage to the forest that their farms cause. In addition, taxes can act as a <strong>deterrent</strong> to undesirable land use.<br>An internal agreement may be made between governments and indigenous or native people living in the moist rainforests and open woodlands of the tropics, where the vast majority of this deforestation is occurring. Such an agreement would allow people to carry on traditional activities adapted for some economic benefit.<br>Finally, international agreements usually involve the exchanges of monetary aid in return for government action to protect its forests. One such plan seeks to help pay a nation’s debt in exchange for restrictions on certain kinds of activities in rainforests. Instead of selling logging concessions to pay down that obligation, the government receives money for banning or restricting logging in its forests. There is also the proposal of a global fund created in order to grant money to countries that choose to protect their environments.<br>It is clear that something must be done to protect the forests of the world. If the current rate of deforestation continues, the world’s rainforests will vanish within 100 years, causing numerous adverse effects on the global climate and eliminating the majority of plant and animal species on the planet.",
