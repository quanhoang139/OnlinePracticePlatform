But when I arrived in Hawaii, I was shocked to discover beaches were covered in plastic rubbish washed up from around the world. As I dug through the sand, I realised the sandy beach was being<strong> transformed</strong> into a plastic beach. A chill <i>went down my spine.</i> From the beaches of Hawaii to the seas around Britain, we are polluting our own environment.<br>Beaches are now covered in more rubbish than ever before. The plastic we see on our beaches is just a small amount of the plastic waste that exists in our oceans. Scientists believe that sea currents have created five huge garbage areas in our oceans, including the one in the North Atlantic. This is a global problem for which we are all responsible.<br>Plastic makes our life easier, but its production and use are completely out of control. Because plastic rubbish in the oceans looks like food, it is being eaten by small fish, which in turn is eaten by large fish, which in turn is eaten by us. Plastic is damaging our beaches, polluting the oceans, and poisoning our food chain. The consequences are still not fully understood, but<strong> they</strong> are likely to be terrible.<br>We need to stop using plastic bags for packaging and single-use water bottles. These make up most of the plastic garbage in the oceans. In Bangladesh and Kenya, they have stopped using plastic bags completely. The UK has put a tax on plastic bags. Many supermarkets around the world are not packing goods in plastic.<br>The future of our beaches, our seas, and the food chain is <strong>at risk</strong>. This is an environmental problem that we need to solve immediately.<br>(Adapted from <i><strong>Headway</strong></i> by Soars, Soars and Hancock)",
