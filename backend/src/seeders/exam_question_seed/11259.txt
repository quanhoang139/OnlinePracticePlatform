However, he <strong>foresaw</strong> its universally destructive powers too late. Nobel preferred not to be remembered as the inventor of dynamite, so in 1895, just two weeks before his death, he created a fund to be used for awarding prizes to people who had made <strong>worthwhile</strong> contributions to humanity. Originally there were five awards: literature, physics, chemistry, medicine, and peace. Economics was added in 1968, just sixty-seven years after the first awards ceremony.<br>Nobel's original legacy of nine million dollars was invested, and the interest on this sum is used for the awards which vary from %(\\$ 30,000)% to %(\\$ 125,000)%.<br>Every year on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death, the awards (gold medal, illuminated diploma, and money) are presented to the winners. Sometimes politics plays an important role in the judges' decisions. Americans have won numerous science awards, but relatively few literature prizes.No awards were presented from 1940 to 1942 at the beginning of World War 11. Some people have won two prizes, but this is rare; others have shared their prizes.",

Chances are it will be the Otis Elevator Company. It was Elisha Otis who invented the gadget that made the modern passenger lift possible. The concept of elevation was already well established. Louis XV of France disliked stairs so much that he was regularly hoisted skywards in a 'flying chair' by several strong men hauling on ropes. In Otis' time, warehouses commonly used moving platforms to transport goods between floors. However, elevating anything further than one floor or weighting more than 70 kilograms would have been considered far too dangerous.<br>Otis worked for a bed manufacturer who was keen to expand his business but needed to find a way to move his beds to an upper floor for storage. The inventive Otis soon had a solution to the safety problem: a tough steel spring system that meshed with ratchets on either side of the lift shaft so that if the rope gave way the sudden loss of tension would <strong>trigger</strong> the device, stopping the lift from falling.<br>At the 1854 World Trade fair in New York, <strong>Otis unveiled his invention and orders began to pour in</strong>, including one from the United States Assay Office which at that time was constructing one  of the first buildings with an internal steel frame to support the exterior walls. This was the same construction method that skyscrapers would use. If not for lifts, the towering landmarks which feature so prominently in today's architecture would have been impossible and the character of our cities would be entirely different.",
