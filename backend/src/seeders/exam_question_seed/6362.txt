It took one of the greatest photographers of all time to change public opinion about photography: Ansel Adams.<br>Ansel Adams claimed that he knew his <strong><u>destiny</u></strong> when he first visited Yosemite, a national park, at the age of fourteen. Until then, the focus of his life had always been music; he had long dreamed of being a concert pianist, a career that would have required him to live an urban lifestyle. Instead, Adams found himself drawn to Yosemite and to other natural settings. Over time his love of photography became more influential than that of music. Contrary to the popular belief of the time, he believed photography to be an art form and often exhibited <strong><u>it</u></strong> as art.<br>Due to his love of nature, Adams became devoted to the conservation of and access to wilderness. He believed that the American people needed to experience nature in all its glory. Adams felt that the experience of nature was a spiritual one, a view evidenced by many of his photographs.",
