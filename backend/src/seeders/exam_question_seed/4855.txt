Also, speaking is very difficult for the deaf because they cannot hear their own voices. However, it is possible with special training. According to many deaf people all around the world, the most practical and popular way of communicating is with sign language.<br>In many ways, sign language is similar to spoken language. The words of sign language are made with signs, which are formed with movements of the hands, face, and body. As with words, each sign has a different meaning and can be combined to form sentences. Sign languages also have their own grammar. The alphabet of sign language is special hand signs that stand for letters; they make spelling possible. The signs combine to form a rich language that can express the same thoughts, feelings, and ideas as any spoken language. And just as people from different countries speak different languages, most countries have their own variety of sign language.",
