This day, rooted in a 1908 demonstration where 15,000 women in New York City stood united for equal rights, better pay, shorter hours, and voting rights, has grown into a worldwide movement. Clara Zetkin, at a meeting in 1910, suggested a special day each year to focus on women's rights, leading to the first International Women's Day in 1911.<br>Despite some beliefs that women have equal chances as men, the reality often tells a different story. Girls worldwide face more household duties than boys and are more likely to miss out on school. In many countries, equal education for both genders is not guaranteed, and many girls are married off young, which can force them to end school early, lead to early pregnancy together with other health issues, and increase the chance of domestic violence.<br>On International Women's Day, people participate in activities that raise awareness and call for gender equality. Wearing purple, a color of women's rights history, is common. <strong><u>It</u></strong> is also a day when women are celebrated with gifts and social recognition in some places.<br>The journey towards full gender equality continues to face challenges. Yet, women's groups across the globe remain strong and active, with younger women and teenagers adding their voices and energy to the cause. They are organizing, speaking out, and urging a shift in how we view and act towards each other regarding gender roles.<br><i><u>(Adapted from https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org)</u></i>",

It is no wonder many experts think that there will be extraordinary changes in the next few decades.<br>As technology develops, highways, skylines, subways will be all <strong><u>transformed</u></strong>. Smarter roadways and highways in cities outfitted with IoT sensors will process all kinds of data in real time and inform users of the best transport options. Weather, crashes, traffic conditions will be communicated to users and smart stops will be found everywhere providing renewable energy, green hydrogen or even greener energy, ensuring efficiency and safety on every highway. Tunnels will also be a smart choice because of the reduction of traffic congestion. Underground roads will be built in 3D with a lift system which will take vehicles deep underground and will allow traffic to <strong><u>attain</u></strong> the greatest speed without intersections.<br>There will also be innovations in the sky. Air taxis are not a new idea, but in the future <strong><u>they</u></strong> will be completely environment-friendly. Aviation gasoline will be no longer used. Green energy will be in place and cost-effective air taxis will enable people to travel from one busy urban city to another in record time.<br>New technologies such as AI and the rollout of 5G will pave the way for fully autonomous innovation. Cars will not be the only thing to go autonomous. Freight trucks, cargo vehicles, air taxis will all benefit from this technology and that is why the term 'driver' will become extinct.<br>Transport will go green. Electric or hydrogen power will be mainstream. There will still be issues to solve such as safety, speed and cost, and of course governments will need to make new traffic laws.<br><i>(Adapted from Friends Global)</i>",
