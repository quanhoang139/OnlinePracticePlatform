The most popular vacation periods are during the summer and during the two-week school break on the Christmas and New Year’s holidays.

American vacationers often travel by car. Most families have a car, and those who do not have a car can rent one. Cars are usually the economical way to travel, especially for the families. It is also fairly fast and convenient. Excellent highways connect the major cities. <strong>They</strong> enable vacationers to travel at an almost steady speed of 55 to 65 miles an hour.
