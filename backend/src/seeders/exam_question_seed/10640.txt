More than half of youths have no idea what job their grandparent did before retirement. Sadly, one in ten <strong><u>admit</u></strong> they are simply not interested in their grandmother's or grandad's talents and interests, and a quarter only turn up to see <strong><u>them</u></strong> for pocket money. But 23 percent claim the reason they don't know anything about their older relatives is that they don't really get the chance to talk properly.<br>Researchers found that although 65 per cent of youngsters do see their grandparents every single week, 37 per cent claim this is only because their parents want them to. And while 39 per cent talk to their grandparents on the phone, Facebook or Skype at least once a week - 16 per cent once a day - conversation is rarely focused on what they are doing or have done in the past. Four in 10 kids have no idea what their grandparent's proudest achievements are, while 30 per cent don't know if they have any special skills or talents. And 42 per cent don't spend any time talking about their grandparent's history -and are therefore clueless about what their grandmother or grandad was like when they were younger. Perhaps due to this lack of communication and respect, just six per cent of children say they <strong><u>look up to</u></strong> their grandparents as a role model and inspiration.",

These days we have to do our jobs, look after our homes, save energy to help the environment, and do exercise to stay healthy! Like many of us, Alex Gadsden never had enough time. He <strong><u>ran</u> </strong>a business and a home and needed to lose weight. So he decided to do something about it. He invented the cycle washer. The 29-year-old now starts each day with a 45-minute cycle ride. He not only feels healthier but he saves on his energy bills and does the washing too.<br>He said, \"It gives the user a good workout. I've only used it for two weeks but I've already noticed a difference.\" \"I tend to get up at around six-thirty now and get straight on the cycle washer. I keep <strong><u>it</u> </strong>in the garden, so it's nice to get out in the fresh air. Afterwards, I feel full of energy. Then I generally have breakfast and a shower and I really feel ready to start the day.\" The green washing machine uses 25 litres of water a wash, and takes enough clothes to fill a carrier bag. He normally cycles for 25 minutes to wash the clothes, and then for another 20 minutes to dry them. And it doesn't use any electricity, of course.<br>Mr Gadsden, the boss of a cleaning company, believes his machine could become very popular. With an invention which cleans your clothes, keeps you fit and reduces your electricity bill, he may well be right.<br>(Adapted from <i>English Unlimited</i> by Alex Tilbury et al.)",
