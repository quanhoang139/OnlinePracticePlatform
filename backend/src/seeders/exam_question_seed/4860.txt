It helps us appreciate the <strong><u>uniqueness</u></strong> of each culture and promotes respect and understanding among people. By celebrating and protecting our diverse heritage, we create opportunities for cultural exchange, which brings people together and helps build a more harmonious and inclusive society.Preserving heritage is not just a responsibility; it is an investment in our collective memory, identity, and the future well-being of generations to come.
