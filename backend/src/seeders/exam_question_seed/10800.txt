Girls are often sneakier about misbehaving, <strong><u>they </u></strong>often say nasty things which end up disrupting  the lesson just as much as the boys, as other children get upset and can’t focus on their work. They are usually the  ones who refuse to comply with instructions.\" In schools that have excluded pupils, 57 per cent of education staff said  that more boys have been excluded for challenging behaviour.<br>Among both sexes, low-level disruption such as talking and not paying attention was the most <strong><u>problematic </u></strong>behaviour  for 70 per cent of respondents. For girls, most staff said bullying such as spreading rumours was the biggest problem.  Among boys the most challenging behaviour was physical aggression. Staff thought the main reasons for challenging<br>behaviour within their schools and colleges were family breakdowns, followed by a lack of positive role models and  poor emotional health. ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: \"The behaviour of both boys and girls can pose  huge challenges for those working in schools and colleges. Staff get ground down daily by the chatting and messing<br>around, which disrupts lessons for other pupils and takes the pleasure out of teaching. \"Even more worrying is the  physical aggression, most often among boys but also among some girls, which puts other pupils and staff at risk. Schools need to have firm and consistent discipline policies and work with parents to keep schools and colleges safe  places for pupils and staff alike.\"<br><i><strong>(Adapted from https://www.cypnow.co.uk/)</strong></i>",
