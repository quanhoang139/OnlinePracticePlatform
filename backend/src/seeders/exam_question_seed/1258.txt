One swims, one walks, and the other flies. But they all have one thing in common. They all migrate. Some migrating animals move to a place with a better temperature. Some go to find food or water. The groups travel as one, trying to survive. During the trip, they face many different challenges.<br>One challenge is distance. Some migrating animals take very long trips. They go far away from their home areas. For example, great white sharks swim from Australia to South Africa and back. In nine months, they swim about 20,000 kilometers.<br>Another challenge is finding enough food add water during the journey. For example, each Mali elephant needs over 200 liters of water each day. To get <strong><u>this</u></strong>, they need to go from one waterhole to another.<br>Finally, migrating animals have to avoid other animals that want to eat them. For example, zebras have to stay away from lions. Travelling as a group helps keep them safe. All the zebras in the group can watch for danger. When one zebra is in trouble, the other members make a circle around it. By working as a group, migrating animals can <strong><u>survive</u></strong> some of the world's most extraordinary journeys",
