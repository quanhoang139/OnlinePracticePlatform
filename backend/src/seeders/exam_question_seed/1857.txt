With plenty of job opportunities available in the city, the inhabitants work as secretaries, businessmen, teachers, government officials, factory workers, street vendors or construction workers and so on. <br>The high cost of living requires city dwellers, especially those with low income, to work harder or to take part-time jobs. For many people, daily life typically involves getting up in the early morning to do exercise in public parks, preparing for a hard day of working and studying, then travelling along crowded boulevards or narrow streets filled with motor scooters and returning home late at night. They usually live in large houses, high-rise apartment blocks or even in small rental rooms equipped with modern facilities, like the Internet, telephone, television, and so on. Industrialization and modernization, as well as global integration, have big impacts on lifestyle in cities. The most noticeable <strong>impact</strong> is the Western style of clothes.
