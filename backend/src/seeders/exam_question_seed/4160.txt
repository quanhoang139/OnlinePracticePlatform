A florist, for example, sells flowers and plants to customers. This is very  relaxing work. A personal trainer, on the other hand, is usually very fit. He or she <strong><u>trains </u></strong>other people to  lose weight and to keep fit.<br>However, research also shows that some jobs are 'unhealthy'. They cause a lot of stress and worry. For  example, a taxi driver drives all day. He often faces traffic jams and difficult passengers too. A firefighter  puts out dangerous fires and sometimes saves people from burning buildings.<br>Most people are looking for the perfect job. <strong><u>They </u></strong>want a job that is interesting, with a good salary and  not much stress. However, it is difficult to get everything. Healthy, relaxing jobs are usually not very  well paid. On the other hand, people with stressful jobs often get good salaries. For example, the head of  a big company gets a lot of money, but he or she does not always have good health, or the time to enjoy  life.<br>(Adapted from <i>New Headway Academic Skills </i>by Richard Harrison)",
