It brings together countries that are rich and poor, large and small, and have different social and political systems.

Each country, no matter how large or small, has an equal voice and vote. Each country is also expected to pay dues to support the UN. As of 2004 the UN had 191 members, including nearly every country in the world.<br>The UN’s influence in world affairs has fluctuated over the years, but the organization gained new prominence beginning in the 1990s. It was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001. Still, the UN faces constant challenges. It must continually secure the cooperation of its member nations because the organization has little independent power or authority. But getting that support is not always easy.

There are many factors that can cause an animal or plant species to become endangered, and one big one is the destruction of their habitats. Deforestation and soil, air, and water pollution are usually the main culprits. For example, the population of critically endangered Sumatran orangutans is now less than 10,000 on their home island of Sumatra, Indonesia, due<br>to <strong>deforestation</strong> and farming.<br>Another cause of endangerment is from humans exploiting wild animals. Uncontrolled hunting of whales in the last century, for example, resulted in many whale species becoming critically endangered. The high demand for animal parts stems from their use in certain foods or medicines or their value as decorative objects. For example, the ivory tusks of elephants are used to make jewelry, and the price is high enough that<br>people risk being arrested and jailed to go after these animals.<br>Introducing a non-native species to an environment can also cause species endangerment. A native species is one that develops naturally in a particular area and has done so for a long time. A non-native species might be introduced into a new environment by humans, either intentionally or by accident. The brown tree snake,<br>unknowingly brought by cargo ships stopping at Guam, has managed to kill off 10 of the 11 species of birds native to the island's forests. In Florida, large pet snakes such as the anaconda and the python have been released into the large Everglades swamp. The snakes have <strong>thrived</strong> in their new environment, and now compete with and may soon overwhelm the swamp's alligators.<br>Organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund and the IUCN try to raise awareness of threatened animals and plants. These organizations collaborate with government agencies to save threatened or endangered species and to make new laws that will protect them. But to really protect plant and animal species now and in the future, the public needs to be educated on the value of keeping these species alive.<br><i>(Adapted from Active skills for reading 3)</i>",
