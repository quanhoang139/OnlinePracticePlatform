Other people thought it was just a light in the sky. And others thought it was a big ball of cheese!<br> The telescopes were made. And men saw that the moon was really another world. They wonder what it was like. They dreamed of going there.<br> On July20, 1969, that dream came true. Two American men landed on the moon. Their names were Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin. The first thing the men found was that the moon is covered with dust. The dust is so thick that the men left footprints where they walked. Those were the first marks a living thing had ever made on the moon. And they could stay there for years and years. There is no wind or rain to wipe them off.<br> The two men walked on the moon for hours. They picked up rocks to bring back to earth for study. They dug up dirt to bring back. They set up machines to find out things people wanted to know. Then they climbed back into their moon landing craft.<br> Next day the landing craft roared as the two men took off from the moon. They joined Michael Collins in the spaceship that waited for them above the moon. Then they were off on their long trip back to earth. Behind them, they left the plains and tall mountains of the moon. They left the machines they had set up. And they left footprints that may last forever.",
