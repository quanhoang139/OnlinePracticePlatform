The first plastics were made more than 100 years ago from parts of plants. Plastics are now made from oil, coal and natural gas. We are using up these things so fast<br>that the Earth's supplies may run out. Because of this, scientists are investigating new ideas for making plastics from plants such as sweet potato, bamboo and flax.<br>Things made from plastic can be useful for people but bad for the environment. Some plastics can last for a long time without wearing out, and can be difficult to <strong><u>get rid of </u></strong>when not needed. <strong><u>They</u></strong> can remain in rubbish dumps called landfill sites for hundreds of years. Landfills can be smelly, ugly, and harmful to our planet.<br>Recycling is a good way to get rid of unwanted plastics. Recycled waste materials can be used again to make new products. This can be difficult as different types of plastic need to be recycled in different<br>ways. Some kinds of plastics can be melted down and used to make new things such as bags and bottles. Others can be made into fibres (strands of material) for clothing.<br>Another way to protect the environment is to use canvas bags for shopping rather than plastic ones. A lot of plastic objects can also be reused. Plastic bottles can be refilled many times, rather than throwing<br>them away once they are empty. Unwanted plastic goods such as CDs and toys can be sold or given away to charity shops.",

In other families, grandparents or professional name-makers come up with a child's name. And in some cases, the time of a child's birth influences how the child's name is determined.<br>In many European cultures, names are typically chosen by parents. Parents' choice for their child's name may be based on names of relatives or ancestors within their particular family. For example, in Italy, children are traditionally named after their grandparents. The parents generally use the father's parents' names first. If they have more children, then they will use the mother's parents' names. Similarly, some people in Eastern Europe name their children after relatives who have died. This tradition is seen as a <strong>means</strong> to protect the child from the Angel of Death.<br>Traditionally in some Asian countries, a child's grandfather or a fortune-teller chooses the child's name. In contrast to the tradition of naming children after relatives, the child's name is chosen to influence the child's character. For example, names may be based on a connection to certain elements such as fire, water, earth, wood, or metal. Or the name might include a written character meaning beauty, strength, or kindness.<br>In certain African cultures, when a child is born plays a large part in determining the child's name. In Ghana's Akan culture, the day a child is born determines the child's name. But each day has different names for boys and girls. For instance, a boy born on Friday is named Kofi, whereas a girl born on the same day is named Afua. Both Kofi and Afua are names meaning \"wanderer\" or \"explorer.\" Children with these names are seen as travelers.<br>No matter where the name comes from, a child's name is the first gift in life. Whether <strong><u>it</u></strong> is chosen according to preference or dictated by tradition, the name reflects something about a child's culture. For that reason, all names should be <strong><u>treasured</u></strong> and respected.",
