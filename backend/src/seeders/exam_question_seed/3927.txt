Unfortunately, that isn’t always easy. Especially during the earliest stages of our careers, we tend to make decisions based on what influencers like our family and friends tell us or by gut feeling.<br>Understanding what motivates you is the first step in defining your ideal career path. Your passion does not necessarily have to be a specific job or industry, but something like “helping others” or “feeling good about yourself”. When you’re starting your first career or jumping into a new one, it can be difficult to identify your natural skills that you can capitalize on. If the new role doesn’t lead to the career track you want to follow, you will need to give yourself some time to explore your skills and understand your potential. After gaining some experience, you will be in a better position to identify your strength and leverage your talent for success.<br>You should think in terms of career opportunities instead of particular jobs. What you need right now may not be aligned with what you want in the long term. For instance, quickly accepting a promotion because of the higher compensation may not be the best option. Instead of focusing on money, think about flexible hours or enjoyable lifestyle. It’s much smarter to make choices based on wishes you can fulfil.<br>Culture is also among the important factors. The working environment, your co-worker, and the company leadership can all contribute to how much or little you enjoy a job. No matter how well a role seems to align with your career goals, it may not be smart to take the role if the culture isn’t right for you.<br>Finally, be sure to consider the future of the profession to which you may be drawn. In our age of rapid technological advances, the world of work is changing constantly. To identify a professional with potential, look at current trends in the industry. If possible, talk to people operating in the field. They may be able to tell you how your chosen career is likely to change in the future.",
