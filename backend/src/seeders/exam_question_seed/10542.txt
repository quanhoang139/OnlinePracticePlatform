Worth approximately US%($ 20)% billion annually, it's the fourth-biggest illegal trade in the world.<br>In Southeast Asia, hunting represents the greatest threat to the future survival of many species, with few native mammals of over 2 kg surviving outside protected areas. Hunting represents a threat to all species, with high-value species <strong><u>sought</u></strong> and traded by criminal groups and smaller species traded for medicine, food or sport.<br>Trade in wildlife in Asia can be grouped into three main types: for medicinal purposes, for status (either in wildlife restaurants or as ornaments) or for the pet, zoo and aquarium trades (principally birds and reptiles).<br>Traditional medicine in Viet Nam and China represents a threat to a wide variety of species, but most <strong><u>notably</u></strong> the pangolin, which is the most trafficked animal on the planet. Sadly, the use of endangered species in medicine shows little sign of decrease. Whereas celebrities have campaigned for species that are targeted for status and ornamentation, such as elephant ivory, many other animals and plants have failed to get the attention needed to prevent over-exploitation. And a number are now facing extinction.<br>    The pet and zoo trade in wildlife, especially for reptiles and birds, have recently received attention, as many species formerly thought to be captive-bred are now known to be wild-caught. <strong><u>They</u></strong> have suffered serious population declines as a result of exploitation for trade.<br>Adapted from: https://theconversation.com/even-as-more-new-species-are-found- outheast- asia-is-in-the-grip- of-a-biodiversity-crisis-67700",
