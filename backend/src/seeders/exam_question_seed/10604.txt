It is widely considered to be one of the greatest architectural masterpieces in the world and is listed as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Every year, the Taj Mahal receives visits from between four and six million tourists from all over the world. Interestingly, less than 500,000 of those visitors are from overseas; the vast majority are from India itself.<br>        UNESCO has designated the building and <strong><u>its</u></strong> grounds as an official World Heritage Site, and there is much concern that the sheer volume of foot traffic may have a negative impact on this wonder of the world. Still, it is hard to blame people in India for wanting to see the Taj, since the growing middle class there finally has the time and leisure to visit their country’s great treasure.<br>        The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628 - 1658) in honor of the Persian princess Mumtaz Mahal, his beloved third wife. She died in 1631 while bearing their fourteenth child, and Shah Jahan never really recovered from the loss. In 1632, he poured his energy into designing and building the most beautiful tomb ever known for her, on the southern banks of the Yamuna River.<br>        It took some 20,000 artisans more than a decade to build the Taj Mahal complex. The white marble stone is inlaid with floral details carved from precious gems. In places, the stone is carved into delicate vined screens called pierce work so that visitors can see into the next chamber. All of the floors are inlaid with patterned stone, and incised painting in abstract designs adorns the walls. The artisans who did this incredible work were <strong><u>supervised</u></strong> by an entire committee of architects, headed by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The cost in modern values was about 53 billion rupees ($827 million US). Construction of the<br>mausoleum was completed around 1648.",

Girls from the wealthiest families marry 2 years later than <strong><u>those</u></strong> from the poorest, who are seen as an economic burden, and who drop out of school and earn little money.<br>        Food insecurity plays an important role too. Nepalese families that do not have enough food to eat are more likely to marry their daughters at a young age to decrease the financial<strong><u> burden</u></strong>. One study shows that 91% of people who had secure access to food married over the age of 19.<br>        Dowry is also common practice in many communities. Parents marry their daughters as soon as possible because the money they have to pay to the groom’s family is higher if their daughter is older. Since 2010, the legal age of marriage is 20 for both men and women, or 18 with parental consent, according to the Nepalese Country Code.<br>        The law states that punishment for child marriage is <strong><u>imprisonment</u></strong> for up to three years and a fine of up to 10,000 rupees (£102). But reports suggest that this law is rarely applied. There has been quite a lot of progress in Nepal over the past 3 years with a clear government commitment to ending child marriage and civil society cooperation. The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare is currently developing Nepal’s first national strategy on child marriage in collaboration with UNICEF Nepal and Girls Not Brides Nepal. However, the post-earthquake and post-fuel crisis environment has meant progress is slow and the national strategy has been delayed.",
