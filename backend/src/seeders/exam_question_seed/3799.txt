Poverty is both a cause and consequence of child marriage in Nepal. Girls from the wealthiest families marry 2 years later than <strong>those </strong>from the poorest, who are seen as an economic burden, and who drop out of school and earn little money.<br>Food insecurity plays an important role too. Nepalese families that do not have enough food to eat are more likely to marry their daughters at a young age to decrease the financial <strong>burden</strong>. One study shows that 91% of people who had secure access to food married over the age of 19.<br>Dowry is also common practice in many communities. Parents marry their daughters as soon as possible because the money they have to pay to the groom’s family is higher if their daughter is older. Since 2010, the<br>legal age of marriage is 20 for both men and women, or 18 with parental consent, according to the Nepalese Country Code.<br>The law states that punishment for child marriage is imprisonment for up to three years and a fine of up to 10,000 rupees (£102). But reports suggest that this law is rarely <strong>applied</strong>. There has been quite a lot of progress in Nepal over the past 3 years with a clear government commitment to ending child marriage and civil society cooperation. The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare is currently developing Nepal’s first national strategy on child marriage in collaboration with UNICEF Nepal and Girls Not Brides Nepal. However, the post-earthquake and post-fuel crisis environment has meant progress is slow and the national strategy has been delayed.<br>(Adapted from http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/)",

However, very few universities can claim to be among the oldest in the world. Nalanda University, in Bihar, India, was established around 600 BC. It was most likely the world's first university. In the past, scholars came from Europe, China, and all over India to learn about science, medicine, the Buddhist religion, and other subjects. The university is in ruins now, but at one time <strong><u>it </u></strong>was an impressive school with temples, classrooms, libraries, and dormitories.<br>According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the University of AI-Karaouine in Fes, Morocco, is the oldest surviving university in the world. It was probably <strong><u>founded </u></strong>in 859 and became a famous place to study natural sciences. The first university in Europe is definitely the University of Bologna, in Italy. It was one of the few universities in Europe that were not influenced by religion. Professors were forbidden from teaching outside the university, and so students came from all over Europe to study with its famous teachers.<br>(Adapted from Active Skills for Reading by Neil J Anderson)",
