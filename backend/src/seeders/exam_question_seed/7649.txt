This large wilderness area is very high in the Rocky Mountains of the northwestern US. It is bigger than the smallest state in the US. Yellowstone became the world’s first national park in 1872. Yellowstone has many different<strong> kinds </strong>of beautiful scenery. Although millions of people visit the park, the land remains unchanged-still a wilderness. The valley of the Yellowstone River has beautiful colored rocks and three large waterfalls. In the early morning or evening, visitors sometimes see large deer-like animals, or buffaloes eating grass along the shores of lake Yellowstone. The high mountains around Yellowstone are covered with evergreen forests.<br>Yellowstone Park has many areas with hot springs. <strong>These</strong> are caused by heat from the hot center of the earth. Old Faithful is the most famous. Every 70 minutes, Old Faithful sends hot water about 150 feet high into the air. When you visit Yellowstone, why not live like a cowboy? You can stay at an Old West country hotel. You’ll enjoy typical cowboy food outdoor. You can ride a horse along one of the many paths or trails. If you like excitement, take a boat trip down the fast Snake River, or spend a quiet summer day fishing by a river or a blue mountain lake. In winter, Yellowstone Park is covered with heavy snow, but visitors still come to skate. With clouds of steam above them and snow all around, Yellowstone’s hot springs look even more wonderful.",
