Have you ever fallen asleep in class? If the answer is yes, then you’re not the only one. Across the world, bedtimes are getting later and teenagers are sleeping less.<br>What are the reasons for this? Well, stress is an important factor Like many young people, I find it hard to go to sleep before a big event such as an exam. Our increasing use of technology may also be to blame? New research at Kings College London, involving 125,000 children and teenagers on four continents, shows that using a phone or tablet before going to bed makes it twice as likely you’ll sleep badly that night. And the following day, this lack of sleep can make it difficult to <strong>concentrate on</strong> studying.<br>But while many schools are attempting to solve this problem by starting the school day later, some schools in New Mexico in the United States are trying something a bit different - they have installed sleeping areas, <strong><u>where</u></strong> students can sleep for 20 minutes in specially designed chairs. I recently fried one of these chairs and my first thought was that it looked like something from a science-fiction film. When I lay down on it, the top part slowly covered my head and upper body so that it became dark inside. Some people might find that scary, but I didn’t mind, and the gentle music was quite nice. I started to feel sleepy, and that was all I could remember until the lights went on and I woke up. Then, when I got up, I noticed I was a bit calmer than I’d been before. I’m sure someone who had slept badly before they went to school would feel a lot better.",
