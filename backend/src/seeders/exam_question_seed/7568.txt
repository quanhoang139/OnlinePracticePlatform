It was a cold April day, and on the ride to Connecticut the Robertses, a couple in their early forties, seemed agreeable enough - no one you would want to spend a long weekend with, but not bad.<br>However at the wedding reception a great deal of liquor was consumed, I should say a third of it by my <strong>chauffeurs</strong>. They were the last to leave the party - at approximately 11pm - and I was most wary of accompanying them; I knew they were drunk, but I didn't realiz how drunk. We had driven about twenty miles, the car <strong>weaving </strong>considerably, and Mr and Mrs Roberts insulting each other in the most extraordinary language, when Mr Roberts very understandably made a wrong turn and got lost on a dark country road. I kept asking them, finally begging them, to stop the car and let me out, but they were so involved in their invectives that they ignored me. Eventually the car stopped of its own accord (temporarily) when it swiped against the side of a tree. I used the opportunity to jump out the car's back door and run into the woods. Presently the cursed vehicle drove off, leaving me alone in the icy dark. I'm sure my hosts never missed me; Lord knows I didn't miss them.",
