Some people might think that joy is the only thing worth pursuing, and that sorrow is something to avoid at all costs. However, this is a shortsighted view.<br>The quote \"We could never learn to be brave and patient, if there were only joy in the world\" is attributed to Helen Keller, a remarkable woman who overcame blindness and deafness to become a renowned author, activist and lecturer. She knew <strong>firsthand</strong> the challenges and hardships that life can bring, but she also appreciated the beauty and meaning that can be found in overcoming them. She believed that joy and sorrow are inseparable, and that they both enrich our lives in different ways.<br>Joy is the natural response to the good things that happen to us, such as love, friendship, success, achievement, pleasure and satisfaction. Joy gives us a sense of happiness, gratitude, fulfilment and optimism. It motivates us to pursue our goals and dreams, and to share our gifts and talents with others. Joy is essential for our well-being and happiness. However, joy alone is not enough to make us complete. Joy can blind us to the realities and needs of others, and to the opportunities for improvement and change. We are not perfect.<br>On the other hand, sorrow challenges us to face our problems and difficulties, and to cope with our emotions and feelings. Sorrow is there to make us more resilient. That said, sorrow alone is not enough to make us grow. Sorrow can <strong>paralyse</strong> us from taking action and moving forward, making us lose sight of our strengths and potentials.<br>Therefore, we need both joy and sorrow in our lives. Joy and sorrow balance each other out, and make us more human.",

Imagine being surrounded by nothing but water, with no land in sight, no help on the way, and no idea how long you will survive. You have to deal with hunger, thirst, exposure, fatigue, and the constant threat of sharks, storms, or pirates. You have to cope with the loneliness, the <strong>despair</strong>, and the fear of never seeing your loved ones again. You have to hope for a miracle, but also prepare for the worst.<br>Some people who have been lost at sea have managed to survive by using their skills, their resources, and their willpower. They have built rafts, caught fish, collected rainwater, and signalled for rescue. They have prayed, meditated, and kept their spirits up. They have found strength in themselves and in their companions. They have lived to tell their stories.<br>But others have not been so lucky. They have <strong>succumbed</strong> to dehydration, hypothermia, infection, or injury. They have gone mad, given up, or drowned. They have vanished without a trace, leaving behind only questions and grief. They have become statistics, or legends.<br>Being lost at sea is a test of human endurance and resilience. It is a challenge that few can overcome, and many cannot imagine. It is a nightmare that no one wants to face.",
