We've recently bought Quantum of Solace, in which Daniel Craig plays the part of Bond. I don't know why the film's got that name- but it's a great movie, anyway. <strong>__________ (19)</strong> have been great, but Daniel Craig, who's made lots of other films, plays the part better<br>than any of them. Even though he doesn't talk very much, I think he's the most perfect actor for the role. He even does a few of the more dangerous things in <strong>__________(20)</strong>, instead of getting someone else to do them. I did wonder sometimes whether he'd be clever enough to defeat the bad people -but I'm not going to tell you the ending! The actress who stars with Craig gives a fantastic performance too- I loved all the glamorous clothes she wore! The director probably had a hard job making this Bond film as full of action as earlier ones. <strong>__________(21)</strong>, with a car chase along a mountain road, and plenty of other thrilling scenes, too - Bond <strong>__________ (22)</strong> and so on. Unfortunately, I found the story difficult to follow in places, and it also <strong>__________ (23)</strong> - it lasted under two hours. I also felt there weren't as many jokes as in the old Bond films. And where was all the ridiculous Bond equipment - the underwater car or exploding watch that everyone laughed at? This is a more serious, darker Bond film, but I still really enjoyed it.",

One surprising fact about global warming is that <strong>it</strong> makes people more aggressive.<br>As the world gets hotter, tempers also get fierier. A new study found that violent crimes and even war become more likely as temperatures rise. Heart rates tend to be <strong>elevated</strong> in warm weather, so people are prepped for a physical response to a situation. That’s not to say we're headed for a violent end as Earth warms up, though.<br>Advances in everything from technology to health have sparked a decline in conflict. It's just that global warming might be slowing that decline. Climate change increases the amount of smog in the air and causes plants to produce more pollen, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Those combine to make breathing harder for people, which can be especially tricky for people with asthma and other respiratory illnesses.",

Here are some of the most common and most serious.<br>The biggest problem is perhaps listing the duties for which you were responsible in a past position: all this tells your potential employers is what you were supposed to do. They do not necessarily know the specific skills you used in <strong>executing</strong> them, nor do they know what results you achieved - both of which are essential. In short, they won’t know if you were the best, the worst or just average in your position.<br>The more concrete information you can include, the better. As far as possible, provide measurements of what you accomplished. If any innovations you introduced saved the organization money, how much did they save? If you found a way of increasing productivity, by what percentage did you increase <strong>it</strong>?<br>Writing what you are trying to achieve in life - your objective - is a waste of space. It tells the employer what you are interested in. Do you really think that employers care what you want? No, they are interested in what they want! Instead, use that space for a career summary. A good one is brief - three to four sentences long. A good one will make the person reviewing your application want to read further.<br>Many resumes list ‘hard’ job-specific skills, almost to the exclusion of transferable, or ‘soft’, skills. However, your ability to negotiate effectively, for example, can be just as important as your technical skills.<br>All information you give should be relevant, so carefully consider the job for which you are applying. If you are applying for a job that is somewhat different than your current job, it is up to you to draw a connection for the resume reviewer, so that they will understand how your skills will fit in their organization. The person who reviews your paperwork will not be a mind reader.<br>If you are modest about the skills you can offer, or the results you have achieved, a resume reader may take what you write literally, and be left with a low opinion of your ability: you need to say exactly how good you are. On the other hand, of course, never stretch the truth or lie.<br><i>(Source: www.ielts-mentor.com)</i>",
