How did we become a throwaway society?<br>First of all, it is now easier to replace an item than to spend time and money to repair it. Thanks to modern manufacturing and technology, companies are able to produce items quickly and inexpensively. Products are plentiful and prices are low, so we would rather buy something new than repair it. Even if we did want to repair something, many items are almost impossible to repair. These products contain<br>many tiny, complicated parts. Some even contain small computer chips. It's easier to throw these items away and buy new ones than to fix them.<br>Another contributing factor is our love of disposable products. As busy people, we are always looking for ways to save time and make our lives easier. Why should we use cloth kitchen towels? It's easier to use paper towel once and toss it out. Companies manufacture thousands of different kinds of <strong><u>disposable</u></strong> items: paper plates, plastic cups, cameras, and razors for shaving, to name a few. The problem is that disposable products also contribute to our trash problem.<br>Our <strong>appetite</strong> for new products also contributes to the problem. We are addicted to buying things. As consumers, we want the latest clothes, the best TVs, and cellphones with the best features. Companies tell us to buy, buy, and buy. Advertisements persuade us the new is better. The result is that we throw away useful possessions to make room for new ones.",
