Most neighborhood diners and cafeterias offer breakfast specials. Some can be as simple as buttered toast with coffee.

The breakfast special is offered daily and run usually from seven until eleven in the morning after which the prices change and everything is ordered a la carte.<br>Some fast-food restaurants offer an “ail-you-can-eat” buffet breakfast which may include more than thirty choices of every breakfast item imaginable. For a set price one can get as many refills as one wants. A complete breakfast will cost less than five dollars with tips included.<br>Some regional favorites also add variety to the American breakfast. In the south grits with butler may replace hash browns, and hot spicy biscuits and gravy seasoned with bits of meat make up a meal in themselves.
