This place was not very far from where I lived and it was easy to get there. It was a very beautiful place. There was a flowing river with clear water that made it more beautiful. I could see some cows <strong><u>roaming</u></strong> the field and eating grass. My brother and sister also went with me that day. With the sun shining and a blue sky over our heads, the day was perfect for enjoying the countryside. After arriving there, we relaxed and enjoyed the natural view around us first. Then we rented a boat and rode <strong><u>it</u></strong> into the river to do some fishing, and luckily, we caught some big fish. Finally, we decided to go for a walk in a beautiful small forest where we discovered a lot of birds and animals. We tried to count how many different kinds of birds and animals there were, but we failed because there were so many.<br>I really enjoyed our day out because it brought me close to a very peaceful and natural environment, away from the busy and noisy city life.",
