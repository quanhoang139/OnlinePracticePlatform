Many people, however, find it overwhelming, as being lifelong learners means they will have to keep studying for their entire life. The following are several strategies to promote lifelong learning.<br>First, start with a clear purpose. Study something that you will likely have many uses in the future. Design learning goals that should serve you in your career path, as well as in your personal interests. You will need to think of the learning experience as continuous investment rather than a one-off endeavor.<br>Second, choose something that is really enjoyable for you. You will need to have fun all through the pursuit of knowledge and skills, which will be an endless journey. The ‘fun' part will always keep you motivated, even during the hard times.<br>Third, lifelong learning is not just about keeping on studying; you will need to think through what you have learned, and find out how to apply it in your work and personal life. Don't read too much and use your brain too little. Think more often; meditate on the ideas that you feel might make your work<br>and/or life better.<br>Those are the key strategies to make sure your lifelong learning is studying smart rather than studying hard. Remember, the lifelong learning movement is unstoppable.",
