The British Broadcasting Company was <strong>established </strong>in 1922. Four years later, it changed its  name to the British Broadcasting Corporation, better known as the BBC. It was not the world's first  radio station. There had already been public radio broadcasts in Britain before 1920. From the beginning the BBC was a public service radio, but also an independent operator. In  the early days of BBC radio, there was not a lot of news on the radio. There were music, drama,  discussions and children's programs; but news was not broadcast until after 7 p.m., to avoid  competition with the newspapers!<br>In 1936 the BBC began the world's first television service. Only a few thousand people in  London could receive those first flickering images. Nevertheless, people liked what they saw, and as  the number of transmitters increased, more and more people went out to buy new television sets. In  1937, tennis was broadcast from Wimbledon for the first time. Then in 1938, football's Cup Final  could be seen, live, by hundreds of thousands of people for the first time ever. Since 1946, the BBC  has become one of Britain's most famous institutions. Today <strong>it </strong>has several national television  channels, lots of radio channels and a growing number of international services.<br><i>(Adapted from https://linguapress.com)</i>",

Thanks to some clever and concerned architects, this image is starting to change. The  concept of green cities aims to bring some beauty from rural environments into urban areas. It is not  only about looking better though. Green cities are also trying to improve the efficiency of cities and  raise the standard of living for people who stay in them.<br>The term “green cities” refers to cities where builders take into account several environmental  factors before those cities are constructed or redesigned to be more physically appealing than  traditional cities from the past. In addition, the mobility of citizens should be considered, so public  transportation can be more convenient and travel time to work can be reduced. Energy sources should  also be evaluated with the goal of minimizing air pollution.<br>When it comes to going green, the city of Barcelona is far ahead of its time. Since 1859, its  designers have consciously tried to create sustainable urban designs. Then in 1992, the city received a  well-deserved makeover before hosting the Olympic Games. In recent years, Barcelona has upgraded  its transportation system. This has reduced air pollution and more workers are using public  transportation instead of their own vehicles. Barcelona also boasts one of the best recycling programs  in the world. Visitors will find clear, color–coded trash bins throughout the city where they can put all  of their materials.<br>It is no secret in Portland, Oregon is one of the greenest cities in the US. Since 1903, it has  been an example of what American cities can accomplish with careful planning. Instead of filling its  area with office buildings, Portland has plenty of green space for activities. It has 119 kilometers of  running, hiking, and bike trails that allow citizens to experience the great outdoors. The city also offers  residents creative energy plans that give them the opportunity to pay a bit extra for clean energy  sources. For about %(3 to)%9 extra each month, homeowners can choose solar or wind power and help  the environment.<br>These are only a small sample of the green cities around the world. As more people experience  the pleasure of visiting green cities, it seems certain that the trend of urban areas going green will  continue far into the future.<br>(Adapted from Read to Achieve by Rich Issak)",
